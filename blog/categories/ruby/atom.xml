    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>RBAC stands for <em>Role Based Access Control</em>.  It is basically a means to programmitically configure access rights without hardcoding.</p>

<p>The full details are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">here</a>, but to be honest I don't fully understand it as writen.  What I understand of it is from trial and error.</p>

<p>This entry is an attempt to codify that understanding and apply it using the ruby language.</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>The inputs to the policy are:</p>

<ol>
<li>User or Actor</li>
<li>Action being performed</li>
<li>Resource being acted on</li>
</ol>


<pre>
    +-------------------------------------------------------+
    | +-------+                                +----------+ |
    | |       |            +------+            |          | |
    | |  User |+---------->|Action|+---------->| Resource | |
    | |       |            +------+            |          | |
    | +-------+                                +----------+ |
    +-------------------------------------------------------+
                               +
                               |
                               v
                            +------+
                            |Policy|
                            +------+
                               +
                               |
                               v
                          +---------+
                          |Yes or No|
                          +---------+

<h2>Policy</h2>

<p>The policy is where the business logic goes.  It can be as simple as a set of Ruby classes that simply return values, or it can be as complicated as ActiveDirectory.</p>

<p>The players are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Role - collection of permissions bound to a user</li>
<li>Permission - an answer which is limited to a resource and action</li>
</ol>


<p>Here is the basic flow of a permission:</p>

<pre>
    +------+            +------+             +------------+
    | User |+---------->| Role |+----------->| Permission |
    +------+            +------+             |------------|
              Has many            Has many   | Resource   |
                                             | Action     |
                                             | Allowed?   |
                                             +------------+
</pre>


<p>A user can have 1 or more roles.  Each role can have 1 or more permissions.  Each permission associates an action on a resource with an answer.  Either the user is explicitly allowed or explicitly not allowed to access the Resource.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> I have purposely kept the data model simple.  In more complicated setups there can be several levels of permissions, permissions can have filters, and/or permissions can be directly bound to a user (instead of being bound to a role).  These complications are often introduced to deal with edge cases which are outside the scope of this article.</p>

<h3>Policy logic sample code</h3>

<p>Once the actors are known the logic is easy.  Simply filter in only the permission on a user for the resource and action in question then "and" all permissions together.</p>

<p>```ruby
class Policy</p>

<pre><code># returns true if the user *can* perform action on resource, false otherwise
def allowed?(user,action,resource)
    reduce_permissions list_permissions(user,action,resource)
end
</code></pre>

<p>private</p>

<pre><code># returns an array of filtered permissions
def list_permissions(user,action,resource)
    perm = user.roles.inject([]) do |array,role|
        array.concat role.permissions.for(resource).with(action).compact
    end
end

def reduce_permissions(perm_array)
    return implicit_allow if perm_array.empty?

    perm_array.reduce(true,:&amp;&amp;)
end

# "and", for "or" use ":||"
def reduce_function
    :&amp;&amp;
end

# default behavior is NOT to give access
def implicit_allow
    false
end
</code></pre>

<p>end
```</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A very common idiom especially when code starts to become complicated is to put functions in modules and mix in that behavior to several classes. And a common expansion is to have a single <code>include</code> add both instance and class methods.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Here is how to do it:
<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1384045.js?file=include.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>module Foo
  def self.included(base)
    base.extend ClassMethods
  end

  module ClassMethods
    def bar
    end
  end

  def baz
  end
end

class Test
  include Foo
end

Test.bar     # class method
Test.new.bar # No method error
Test.baz     # No method error
Test.new.baz # Instance method
</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p><code>include</code> is used to add a module's instance methods as instance methods to the including class, but it doesn't traverse sub modules. <code>extend</code> is used to add a module's instance methods as class methods to a class.</p>

<p>When a module is <code>included</code> it can register a callback which is passed the class that is doing the including. And calling <code>extend</code> on the base and passing a submodule will cause it to put those methods at the class level. This causes a chain reaction of loading both instance and class methods using a single <code>include</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: It is possible to cause the same behavior using <code>extend</code> by using the <code>extended</code> callback; however, this is not common and <code>include 'x'</code> reads better then <code>extend 'y'</code>.</p>
