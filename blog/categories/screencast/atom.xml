    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So part of my job has been to give screencasts of some of the projects I have been working on.  Having a Mac I can use iMovie to pretty much do everything, but I struggled with the structure and timing of the screencasts.</p>

<p>The issue was that I know pretty much everything about the feature I implemented, so I would just go at it.  I would often get confused, start over, or go off on a tangent.  By the end everything took longer then it should, and wasn't as good as it should have been.  Over all very frustrating.</p>

<p>I don't know why I didn't think about this sooner and why this isn't the first thing people tell when you start doing screencasts, but start with a screenplay.  The movie industry has decades of experience and they start each movie with a pitch and a screenplay.</p>

<p>Think of a screenplay like a wireframe for your video.  Everything about them is about making things simple to understand.  Below is a simplified version of <a href="http://2012.scriptfrenzy.org/howtoformatascreenplay">the screenplay format</a> applied specifically to screencasts.</p>

<p>I have a sample Google doc file <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tstVIrAOQlfjjttxyjK_igDmrrIFf4IYuHhNJQljOQY/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<li>For screencasts

<ol>
<li>omit the internal/external indicator (you are always in a computer)</li>
<li>omit the time of day indictor</li>
<li>Add a Website / Program indicator</li>
<li>Add an off screen indicator (O.S.), this either needs to be prior to recording or will be removed post production</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p>```
GOOGLE PLUS - LOGIN - OFF SCREEN</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>GOOGLE PLUS - ADD FRIEND TO CIRCLE
```</p>

<h3>Action</h3>

<ol>
<li>Optional</li>
<li>Immediately after Slug line</li>
<li>Describes setup of screen (work performed off screen, prior to recording)</li>
<li>Left aligned</li>
</ol>


<p>```
GOOGLE PLUS - ADD A FRIEND TO CIRCLE</p>

<p>Two accounts exist.  Account 1 is logged in.</p>

<p>Search for account 2.
```</p>

<h3>Character name</h3>

<ol>
<li>Above parenthetical or dialog - Anytime the person speaking changes</li>
<li>All Caps</li>
<li>4 tabs in (2")</li>
<li>For screencasts

<ol>
<li>Use PRESENTER X (omit the X if only one presenter)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p>```</p>

<pre><code>    JOHN

  (doing something)

And talking


    JANE

Just talking
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Parenthetical</h3>

<ol>
<li>Immediately after character name</li>
<li>Used to show actions performed while talking</li>
<li>3 tabs in (1.5")</li>
<li>For screencasts

<ol>
<li>Use generic terms like "highlight", and "submit form" instead of very specific "move mouse to" and "click submit button"</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<h3>Dialog</h3>

<ol>
<li>Immediately after character name or parenthetical</li>
<li>What the character says</li>
<li>No quotes</li>
<li>Present tense</li>
<li>Only explain what isn't covered by the video

<ol>
<li>For example it is fine to use Jargon like "goto google" because in the video you will be opening the browser, going to the URL bar, and typing in "http://google.com".</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>2 tabs in (1")</li>
</ol>
