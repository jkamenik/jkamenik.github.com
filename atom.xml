    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As always, last nights B&#8217;More on Rails meetup was enjoyable.  There were two talks and a lot of the new people.  The first talk was on solving the &#8220;Eight queens&#8221; problem in Haskell.  The second was about Postgresql and Rails 4.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Eight Queens</h2>

<p>For those - like me - that are not familar with this problem the full details are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">here</a>.  Basically, given an 8x8 board place 8 queens such that no queen can attach another queen.  In actuality Robert solved the more difficult N-Queens problem using Haskell.</p>

<p>The solution was to brute force through all combinations until a solution is reached.  This would seem to be a slow approach, but haskell (as a functional language) is setup for these kinds of tasks.</p>

<p>As a Rails guy I found the syntax of Haskell extremely difficult to understand.  However, Robert was a fantastic and funny speaker; turning an otherwise dry programming talk into an interesting presentation about trails and pitfalls.</p>

<p>One such pitfall Robert explained was using the imutable list which caused the calcuation time to grow by an order of magnatude.  By swaping the imutable list with a mutable set the calcuation time was reduced dramatically.  Sure, using something mutable violates the purity of a &#8220;pure functional&#8221; language, but Haskell appears to allow some wiggle room.</p>

<p>Another pitfall was in understanding and using Monads.  After reading on my own, my best guess is that a Monad is simply context for containing a non-functional (in the sense of not allowed in a functional language) behavior.</p>

<p>All-in-all I don&#8217;t think I will be running out to try Haskell, but I would like to hear another talk from Robert.</p>

<h2>Postgresql and Rails 4</h2>

<p><a href="http://decomplecting.org/rails4-postgres/#/">Slides</a></p>

<p>The second talk wasn&#8217;t so much about Rails 4, but more about ActiveRecord 4 and how it has introduced direct support for some of the nicer Postgresql features.  This talk was jam packed with examples and references.  The full slides are linked above.  The summary is:</p>

<ol>
<li>ActiveRecord adds the following columns types

<ol>
<li>Array</li>
<li>UUID</li>
<li>HStore</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>ActiveRecord adds direct support for GiN and GiST indexes</li>
<li>The following gems are still useful:

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lomba/schema_plus">schema_plus</a>

<ol>
<li>Adds a reduced migration syntax - do more with one line</li>
<li>Adds foreign key constrains</li>
<li>Adds views</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Casecommons/pg_search">pg_search</a>

<ol>
<li>Makes direct database searching easier</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dockyard/postgres_ext">postgres_ext</a>

<ol>
<li>Adds native postgresql types to ActiveRecord</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You should read <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx">The Vietnam Of Computer Science</a></li>

    <link href="http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2014/03/23/inbox-zero-part-1/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-23T16:45:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2014/03/23/inbox-zero-part-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first in a series of posts related to reducing the number of emails in your inbox, and more importantly, keeping it reduced.  This idea comes from the world of GTD (specifically 43Folders) and is a good strategy for anyone who needs quick access to “important” emails.</p>

<p>The filter-then-process method that I am about to describe works with pretty much any job you can think of: You sort laundry then wash it, you rake leaves into piles before you bag them, you collect dishes before you wash them.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Everything I describe is done with stock Gmail: no add-ons, no configurations, no 3rd party tools.  Just vanilla Gmail.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I do not to live out of email, but part of my job requires reading it.  I check email at most twice a day, and I am still more responsive than anyone else at the company; especially those that who  “live” out of email.</p>

<p>The reason is focus.  Those who jump around have too much to focus on, and lose details.  They are great people for the quick one-line “Got it” emails, but rarely have any follow-through.</p>

<h2>The goal</h2>

<p>The goals are simple: see the emails worth reading and responding to.  To achieve this we are going to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set up Gmail and develop a process</li>
<li>Move non-emails out of Email</li>
<li>Automate the process</li>
<li>Refine the process</li>
<li>Enjoy our free time</li>
</ol>


<h2>The Fear of Missing Out</h2>

<p>At this point you are probably looking at my comment on checking email twice a day and thinking “that will never work for me.”  Chances are you said to yourself “What if I miss out on something important,” or a variant like:</p>

<ol>
<li>What if I miss an email that my child/husband/wife/father/mother is in trouble?</li>
<li>What if my boss emails me work that must be done immediately?</li>
<li>What if my friends invite me to a party and I miss the email?</li>
</ol>


<p>To that I say “nonsense.”  Your mind is inventing scenarios that will never happen.  Nobody has ever turned to email in times of emergencies.  If a boss wants something immediately they will tell you in person, or over the phone. And if your friends were really inviting you to a party, they would do so via Evite, Meetup, or something similar.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Here all I did was tell you that this way of processing your email will work.  In the next post we will actually get started on the process.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p><strong>Wednesday 2/19</strong> Mel starts having labor.  The contractors were about 10 minutes apart and between 30s and 1m.  They slow and stop by noon.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday 12am</strong> Contractions start again and are fairly regular.  Just need to wait until they are 5 minutes apart before we start calling people.</p>

<p><strong>1am</strong> Contractions are 5 minutes apart so we call Mel&#8217;s family to come down and pick up Frankie, call my family to come and pick up the dogs, and call the Doula.</p>

<p><strong>2:15am</strong> Doula arrived.  And after a bit we decide to call the Midwife.  The midwife tells us to wait another hour</p>

<p><strong>3am</strong> Mel&#8217;s parents arrive.</p>

<p><strong>3:45am</strong> We leave for the Hospital.</p>

<p><strong>5am</strong> We are in triage.  And they are running tests.</p>

<p><strong>5:40am</strong> We are discharged, because we are only 2cm dilated.  You have to be 4 to 5 cm to be admitted.</p>

<p><strong>6:30am</strong> We are home again, and try to relax.</p>

<p><strong>11am</strong> Midwife appointment.  We are 5cm dilated.  They tell us to go walk around for 2 hours and report to the hospital again.  We head to the near by Annapolis mall to eat lunch, and walk around.  I am massaging Mel’s back as she has contractions while we walk.  People stare but we don’t care.</p>

<p><strong>1:30pm</strong> Go back to the hospital, are admitted and settle into our room.</p>

<p><strong>7pm</strong> Not making much progress so they give us some options: go home, stay have the water broken and risk the C-Section.  We counter with stay but walk.  They allow us to unhook from the monitors and walk the halls.  So we walk constantly for 2+ hours.</p>

<p><strong>11pm</strong> Re-checked and she had progressed to 8 cm dilated.  Walking really did the trick.</p>

<p><strong>Friday 12am</strong> Water spontaneously broke while laying in bed.  I was holding her hand through the contractions, in socks.  You can imagine what happened to the those socks :)</p>

<p>Now we are on the clock.  Mel is still at 8cm, and Ronin is at -2 station.  There are still many hours of labor left.</p>

<p>About 10 minutes after the water broke the first dry contraction starts.  It many many many times more powerful and painful then the back labor she has been dealing with so far.  Mel (against her birth plan) wants an epidural.  The doula, nurse, and I are getting Mel through the contractions one at a time, by being positive and telling her she can do it.</p>

<p>The hardest part is getting Mel relaxed after the contractions, but they are coming every few seconds.  After many contractions we relent and agree on the epidural if she promises to take a nap so that when it is time to push she is ready.</p>

<p>(As an aside, she probably could have gone a lot further without the meds, but with so little sleep we were risking another C-Section if she was too tired to push)</p>

<p><strong>12:30am</strong> The epidural is put in, which is difficult because you have to remain still and relaxed.  Pretty much impossible when you are contracting, so the Dr has to work between contractions.</p>

<p>After the epidural is in we settle down for our first sleep since Tuesday.  Its not going to be great sleep, but we all know that the hardest part is yet to come.</p>

<p><strong>6am</strong> Mel feels an almost uncontrollable urge to poop, which is a sign that she needs to start pushing.  This is hardest part.</p>

<p>We have to wait until we are seen by the Midwife.  After we are checked we get the news that Mel is 9+ cm dilated but Ronin is still at -1 / -2 station.  This means that he has not yet engaged.  He should be at 0 or 1 by this point.</p>

<p>The Midwife suggests that Mel perform some practice pushing just to get Ronin engaged.  Then we can take another nap and start again.</p>

<p>The next time Mel feels the urge she pushes, while the Doula and I hold her legs.  She pushed him to engagement, so the Midwife starts massaging the cervix to get it around his head.  A few pushes later Ronin is descending.  The Midwife is very happy with the quality, strength, and duration of Mel&#8217;s pushes.</p>

<p><strong>6:45am</strong> The Midwife points out the very top of Ronin&#8217;s head, which is just visible, and doesn&#8217;t retract between pushes.  This means that Mel&#8217;s &#8220;practice&#8221; pushing will actually birth Ronin.</p>

<p>About 3 pushes later and he is fully crowning.  The Midwife holds her hand on Ronin&#8217;s head to prevent him from ejecting and calls for a gown.  The room is teaming with Doctors and nurses now, and she is given freedom to push.</p>

<p>1 push and the head is out.  Couple pushes later his shoulders.</p>

<p><strong>7:04am</strong> Ronin is born and laying on Mel&#8217;s chest.  They give her a few moments before taking him for clean up and scoring.</p>

<p><strong>8am</strong> Everything went well.  Ronin has a 1 minute Apgar score of 8 and 5 minute score of 9.  He is looking great and we are left alone for several hours to enjoy our new baby.</p>

<p><strong>10am</strong> The nurse comes back in to give Ronin his first bath, and check him over again.  They are still waiting for a recovery room to become free so we remain in the delivery room.</p>

<p><strong>3pm</strong> They have a recovery room for us. So we move.  Ronin was a no risk delivery, so they only need to observe him for 24 hours from the first feeding, which was about 7:30.  We elect to leave as soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday 2pm</strong> Ronin has had all the tests done, and the lactation consult has been in to help Mel with breast feeding, and we are free to leave.  Breast feeding is going much easier with Ronin; 90% of it is that Mel is more relaxed.</p>

<p>With our first, leaving the hospital was a nerveracking time, but with our second we already know what we are doing, and we already have all the stuff.  We are ready to go.  I can&#8217;t wait to sleep in my own bed, next to my wife.</p>

<h2>What I have learned (this time)</h2>

<p>Each baby is different, and I am not a medical professional.  Everything I listed here is true for my baby only.</p>

<ol>
<li>Each baby is different.  For example:

<ol>
<li>Frankie slept for the first week, even sleeping through feedings.  Ronin was awake for several hours after birth, and spends several hours a day awake.</li>
<li>Frankie could lift his head after 1 week.  Ronin was born with the ability to lift his head.</li>
<li>Frankie was easier to carry because he was a lump.  Ronin moves a lot and throws his head around and is much harder to carry when he is awake.</li>
<li>Frankie didn’t care to be held.  Ronin prefers to be held.</li>
<li>Frankie prefers to sit in his own filth rather than being changed.  Ronin hates to be dirty and prefers to be changed.</li>
<li>Frankie fit well into a size bigger (3 month clothes when he was born).  Ronin is slightly longer than Frankie, but lighter so nothing fits him correctly.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Each pregnancy is different

<ol>
<li>Each pregnancy gets harder.  The pains hurt worse during pregnancy and the after pains are wrose as well.</li>
<li>Each pregnancy gets easier.  Even though everything hurts more you are expecting it, and can better deal with it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Life is hardest after the first one.  It is hard to go from “without kids” to “with kids”.  But once you are “with kids” two kids is not that much harder than one.  You have already baby proofed the house, and changed your life around.</li>
<li>Allowing comments on your baby’s birth story is stupid.  I learned that after the first one.  Therefore I have disabled them on this one.  Sorry for anyone that wants to wish us well, but one can ruin it for everyone.</li>
<li>Sleep is less of an issue with the 2nd.  To be honest we get a lot less sleep this time around.  The difference is that we know we are going to get sleep 30 minutes at a time.  And we love it when he gives us more.  With Frankie we were scared to sleep because we should only get 1 hour or so.</li>
<li>A vaginal birth is front loaded, while a C-Section is back loaded.  I am not a proponent for one vs the other, but in our case the C-Section was over and done with in a matter of minutes.  The vaginal birth took hours (31 to be exact).  In the C-Section case, all of the recovery started after the birth with 3 days in the hospital.  With the VBAC once the delivery was over we were free to go.  So with Vaginal birth (assuming there are no complications) everything happens leading up to the birth, with a C-Section everything happens after the birth.</li>
<li>Writing a birth plan, having a Doula, and using Midwifes was ideal for us.  Everyone was really supportive, and the Doula stayed with us the entire time.  The midwives and nurses reviewed the birth plan and where very engaged with us if there were reasons we had to go off plan.</li>
</ol>

    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2014/02/24/crafty-timer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Crafty JS is a game engine written in Javascript.  Like many game engines there is a main event loop that drives everything.  This is actually a great thing, unless you are trying to use timers.</p>

<p>Javascript is single threaded but asynchronous.  This means there is no way to &#8220;sleep&#8221; the main loop.  Instead there is a <code>setTimeout</code> function which takes a callback that is called after the timer has expired.  In most JS programs having one or more timers setup via <code>setTimeout</code> isn&#8217;t much of an issue.</p>

<p>In Crafty there is already a main event loop that actually performs the same function and it better fits the separation of background and rendering responsibilities.  Remember that in a game you will have hundreds or thousands of background calculation per second but only 40 to 60 rendering calculations.</p>

<p>With that in mind I created two components: a Timer which does everything in the background, and TimePrinter which is a timer and rerenders the current seconds until the timer expires.</p>

<p><code>start</code> starts the timer.  It binds to the &#8220;EnterFrame&#8221; event and sets up a proxy callback to ensure the &#8220;this&#8221; variable is maintained during the callback.</p>

<p><code>stop</code> remotes the &#8220;EnterFrame&#8221; callback thereby detacting it from the timer loop.</p>

<p><code>expiresIn</code> sets up a number of seconds to expire the timer in.  There is an optional second paramter to start the timer loop.</p>

<p><code>addSeconds</code> adds seconds to the existing timer, making it take longer to expire.  If the timer has expired then it behaves like <code>expiresIn</code></p>

<p><code>_calculateTime</code> is the work horse.  It calculates the real time and compares it to the expire time and returns the number of seconds until it expires.  If the current time is greater or equal to the expire time then the timer is considered expired and is stopped.  Stopping the timer removes any useless calculations, speeding up the overall game.</p>

<h2>Time Printer</h2>

<p>In order to separate concerns I created a separate component to print the number of seconds until the timer expires.  By separating things out I can have a general purpose timer which is displayed many different ways.</p>

<p>This class simply shows the number of seconds left as a string.</p>

<p><code>init</code> requires the DOM, 2D, and Text components so that I can render text.  It also requires Timer so that it behaves like a Timer.  It also binds to the &#8220;RenderScene&#8221; event, which just rendering thread.</p>

<p><code>render</code> is the call back called when it is time to render the entity.</p>

    <link href="http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2014/02/17/crafty-js/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-17T12:53:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2014/02/17/crafty-js</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I started playing Clash of Clans on the iPhone, which is a City building game.  It is a free app that uses in-app purchases to speed up your progress.  I have tried many of these types of games and there is something addictive about them.</p>

<p>Why not build my own game?  Great idea, but I know nothing about game design.  I am just a programmer.  So a bit of Googling later and I have a small list of required items.  All of which are required to get a game published.  Basically, not useful to me, since I want to learn, not sell.</p>

<p>So instead of building the next award winning game that will make me a millionare I am going to play to my strength of programming and slowly move into the other area that are needed for an engaging game.</p>

<p>That is where Crafty comes in.  <a href="http://craftyjs.com/">Crafty</a> is a Javascript game engine.  Unfortunately their documentation sucks, so I am writing what I understand (though it is probably wrong).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I chose Crafty because it was literally the first thing that came up when I googled &#8220;javascript game engine&#8221;.  So I jumped into the <a href="http://buildnewgames.com/introduction-to-crafty/">getting started guild</a>, and followed it in my own <a href="https://github.com/jkamenik/crafty_tutorial">repo</a>.</p>

<p>A game is built by combining various types of objects together.  This is a basic list of the Crafty objects.</p>

<h2>Scenes</h2>

<p>A scene is the groundwork for a distinct part of the game.  One might be the loading screen that shows the user that things are happening.  Another might be the actual game screen.  Another might be a &#8220;game over&#8221; screen.</p>

<p>Scenes are registered with <code>Crafty.scene</code> which takes 3 arguments</p>

<ol>
<li>Name - A string representing the scene name</li>
<li>init function - a function to set up the scene</li>
<li>uninit function - a function called to stop the scene (called after 2D objects are destroyed)</li>
</ol>


<p><code>Crafty.enterScene</code> can be used to enter a new scene (and by extension destroy the current scene).</p>

<h2>Component</h2>

<p>A component encapsulates data and behaviors into reusable parts.  There are already many prebuilt components like <code>SpriteAnimation</code> which allows a sprite to animate itself, and &#8220;Collision&#8221; which allows object to detect if they have hit a convex polygon.</p>

<p>Components are registered with <code>Crafty.c</code> which takes 2 arguments</p>

<ol>
<li>Name - A string representing the component</li>
<li>Object - A JS object representing the data and behaviors of the component</li>
</ol>


<p>There are two special functions:</p>

<ol>
<li>init - is called when the component is included within an entity</li>
<li>remove - is called when the component is removed or an entity is destroyed.  If it is being called because of an entity then it is passed a single &#8220;true&#8221; argument.</li>
</ol>


<p>By convention if you provide a function that has the same name as the component then it is used as a constructor by the entity.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Entity</h2>

<p>An entity is an individual and distinct object in the game.  They are usually made up of one or more Components, but are not necessarily visible to the user.  Your player character will be an entity that might include a keyboard event component as well as a collision component and sprite component.</p>

<p>Entities are created with <code>Crafty.e</code> which takes a single argument:</p>

<ol>
<li>Components - Either a comma separated list of component names, or a set of strings each being their own components</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">Crafty</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Collision, Fourway&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// is the same as</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">Crafty</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Collision&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Fourway&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Events</h2>

<p>Events come in two flavors: Component and Global events.  Component events happen to or on an Entity that has included the Component.  For example the player entity may include the &#8220;Fourway&#8221; component which would add the &#8220;Moved&#8221; event.  Anyone (including the player itself) could listen for that event and know when the player moved.</p>

<p>Global events are registered to and triggered from the global Crafty object.  The tricky part with global events is that they do not have be registered or used, so it is up to you to make sure that you document events that you trigger and correctly bind to those events.</p>

<p>An event is triggered with <code>Crafty.trigger</code> which takes any number of arguments.</p>

<ol>
<li>Name - the name of the event to trigger</li>
<li>data - All the rest of the arguments are blindly passed to any event listener</li>
</ol>


<p>An event is listened for using one of the following.  All of them accept two arguments: the name of the event, and the callback function when the event is triggered.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>bind</code> - listen for event</li>
<li><code>uniqueBind</code> - same as bind, but prevents other event listeners for the same event</li>
<li><code>one</code> - same as bind, but automatically unbinds itself after the first event is triggered</li>
</ol>


<p>Note: in general you should use a named function as the callback.  That way scenes can <code>unbind</code> event listeners when they become inactive (thereby saving the overhead of intercepting events that cannot be acted upon).</p>

<h2>Assets</h2>

<p>An asset is anything data that might need to be loaded before a scene can be played.  This might be images, audio, video, or player data.  Assets are globally registered and can be loaded anyway you see fit, but for convenience there is a loader object which does the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>Assets are loaded with <code>Crafty.load</code> which takes up to 4 arguments</p>

<ol>
<li>assets - an array of the asset URLs to load</li>
<li>onLoad - call after ALL assets are loaded</li>
<li>onProgress - called after each asset is loaded.  It is called with the loaded asset, the total number of assets being loaded, and percentage complete.</li>
<li>onError - called when an asset fails to load.</li>
</ol>


<p>Assets that have been loaded can be acquired using <code>Crafty.asset</code> which takes 1 argument</p>

<ol>
<li>key - the unique name of the asset.  Usually it is the URL used to load the asset.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Sprites</h2>

<p>A sprite is just a component, but it is likely to be one of the most common components of your game that it bares introduction.  Basically a sprite is an image shown to the user.  They could be used for the player, or obstacles on the game board, or for the game board itself.</p>

<p>There is a Sprite component in Crafty, which will almost never be used by itself.  Instead <code>Crafty.sprite</code> will be used to split an image into one or more registered sprite components that you will use.  It takes a variable number of arguments</p>

<ol>
<li>tiles (optional) - the number of tiles in the image.  Each image is assumed to be square so if this number was &#8220;16&#8221; it would assume there are 4 columns and 4 rows.</li>
<li>tileWidth, tileHeight (optional) - The width and height of individual tiles.  Either use this or &#8220;tiles&#8221;, but not both</li>
<li>url - The URL of the loaded image.  This should be preloaded by the <code>Crafty.loader</code></li>
<li>map - map of the sprites to register from this image in the form

<ol>
<li>key - the name of the Sprite component</li>
<li>value - array of offset and size attributes

<ol>
<li>x offset</li>
<li>y offset</li>
<li>width (optional)</li>
<li>height (optional)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>paddingX (optional) - horizontal space between tiles</li>
<li>paddingY (optional) - vertical space between tiles</li>
<li>paddingArroundBorder (optional) - if true then there is assumed to be the same amount of padding between the edge of the image and tile as there is between tiles.</li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night I attended the B&#8217;More on rails meetup group&#8217;s monthly presentation.  Always a group crowd.  Always good pizza.  And always good talks.</p>

<p>Last nights talks where about Polymer and the JVM.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Polymer</h2>

<p>Presented by Chris Strom</p>

<p>Before the meeting started we still only had 1 presentor, so Chris whipped together a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk">lightning talk</a> on Polymer.  He has been blogging about it for some time, and is in the process of writing a book on Polymer.</p>

<p>Polymer is horizontal in scope.  Instead of taking over the entire rendered page like Angular, jQuery, or Backbone, it isolates itself to sub page elements utilizing <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/">Shadow Dom</a>.</p>

<p>The simpliest way to think about a Shawdow DOM is like an HTML namespace.  Programming languages have long had namespaces to isolate parts of code and keep things maintainable.  HTML has never had this, so reusable components have been a real headache.</p>

<p>HTML 5 is trying to change that with a lot of advanced techniques, and Polymer is wrapping that in an easier to use library for programmers.</p>

<h2>The JVM</h2>

<p>Presented by Gary Trakhman</p>

<p>The sides are <a href="https://github.com/gtrak/jvmrubyists">here</a></p>

<p>It is nice to see new presentors.  I am not sure if he is new to the group, but I have not seen him present before, so props for that.</p>

<p>The talk itself was an overview of many concepts about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), but not really about the Java programming language, and not deep in any one area.  Gary (as well as most of us in the Ruby community) find the Java language too verbose to be useful.  There were some Java examples just to give a comparison to Ruby, but his main examples were using Closure.</p>

<p>The JVM uses a Just In Time (JIT) compiler to take bytecode and translate it into platform specific instructions.  The instructions for Linux are different from Windows are different from BSD, but the bytecode is universal.  Java, JRuby, and Closure are just programming languages that produce bytecode.</p>

<p>After the presentation Gary went into a live demo using a Closure console to execute code in real time.  The console simply starts a JVM, pipes it bytecode, and then prints the results in the terminal.  With the JVM running he also open the visiual profiler - which is provided in the Java Development Kit - so we could see the performace metics of the running code.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Testing a controller that your engine provides is tricky.  But with rspec the easiest way I have found is to follow these 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add <code>type: controller</code> to the describe block</li>
<li>Add <code>routes { Your::Engine.routes }</code> block to the top of the tests</li>
<li>Add <code>controller</code> block to the top</li>
</ol>

<p>Adding <code>type: controller</code> forces Rspec to treat this as a &#8220;controller&#8221; test.  And it will mix in the &#8220;controller&#8221; object, and REST helpers (get, post, put, patch, delete).</p>

<p>Adding <code>routes {...}</code> sets up default routing for the REST helpers, so they can find your controller.  If that is too heavy handed you can pass <code>use_route</code> (see below).</p>

<p>Adding the <code>controller</code> block forces rspec to create an annoyomous controller double.  I use this to provide default function that the <code>ApplicationController</code> from the host app would provide; like <code>current_user</code>.</p>

<h2>use_route</h2>

<p>Instead of <code>routes {...}</code> you could provide the <code>use_route</code> param to the REST helpers.  The value is a symbol that constantizes to your Gem&#8217;s namespace.  You need to provide it every helper (which is why I prefer the <code>routes</code> block).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jekyll supports unpublished posts, but Octopress does not make it clear.  This is how I fixed that for my own blog.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Octopress actually does support &#8220;published: false&#8221; in the front matter.  And because it based on Jekyll it means that those posts will be available in &#8220;preview&#8221; but will be ignored when the site is generated/published.</p>

<p>My main care is that I know what I can do with a post in 3 to 4 months.  So I added the the published flag to the generated frontmatter of every new post.</p>

<p>I also had to update <code>rake push</code> to regenerate the full site before deployment.  This is because preview works on the same directly that is copied to production.  And since you can preview unpublished posts they will be visible in production, unless you run <code>rake generate</code> first.</p>

<p>Additionally I want to know visually when a page is a draft.  For that I add &#8220;Draft: &#8221; to the title.</p>

<p>Now you will see &#8220;Draft: &#8221; in front of any unpublished posts.</p>

<h2>Manual management</h2>

<p>A few additional things I like to do, but I haven&#8217;t automated yet are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add &#8220;-draft&#8221; to the file name.</li>
<li>Change the publish date to the day I publish the article

<ol>
<li>This involves changing the file name as well as the front matter</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>RBAC stands for <em>Role Based Access Control</em>.  It is basically a means to programmitically configure access rights without hardcoding.</p>

<p>The full details are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">here</a>, but to be honest I don&#8217;t fully understand it as writen.  What I understand of it is from trial and error.</p>

<p>This entry is an attempt to codify that understanding and apply it using the ruby language.</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>The inputs to the policy are:</p>

<ol>
<li>User or Actor</li>
<li>Action being performed</li>
<li>Resource being acted on</li>
</ol>


<pre>

                               |
                               v
                          +---------+
                          |Yes or No|
                          +---------+
</pre>


<h2>Policy</h2>

<p>The policy is where the business logic goes.  It can be as simple as a set of Ruby classes that simply return values, or it can be as complicated as ActiveDirectory.</p>

<p>The players are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Role - collection of permissions bound to a user</li>
<li>Permission - an answer which is limited to a resource and action</li>
</ol>


<p>Here is the basic flow of a permission:</p>

<pre>
    +------+            +------+             +------------+
    | User |+---------->| Role |+----------->| Permission |
    +------+            +------+             |------------|
              Has many            Has many   | Resource   |
                                             | Action     |
                                             | Allowed?   |
                                             +------------+
</pre>


<p>A user can have 1 or more roles.  Each role can have 1 or more permissions.  Each permission associates an action on a resource with an answer.  Either the user is explicitly allowed or explicitly not allowed to access the Resource.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> I have purposely kept the data model simple.  In more complicated setups there can be several levels of permissions, permissions can have filters, and/or permissions can be directly bound to a user (instead of being bound to a role).  These complications are often introduced to deal with edge cases which are outside the scope of this article.</p>

<h3>Policy logic sample code</h3>

<p>Once the actors are known the logic is easy.  Simply filter in only the permission on a user for the resource and action in question then &#8220;and&#8221; all permissions together.</p>

    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2013/09/28/tdc-prototype</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2013/09/01/technical-debt-calculator/">previous post</a> I talked about creating a Technical Debt Calculator.  And in an <a href="#">even earlier</a> post I talked about using Keynote to mockup UIs before coding.  Here I revisit the TDC with a Keynote mockup.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Working prototype</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://jkamenik.github.com/assets/Technical%20Debt%20Calculator.pdf">working prototype</a> is a clickable PDF.  You will need Adobe Acrobat Reader or a Mac computer.  From there just download the PDF and play with it.</p>

<p>I used concepts that I gained from working with <a href="http://keynotopia.com/">Keynotopia</a>.  Keynotopdia is an awesome library, which you should own, but at a minimum you should check out their tutorials <a href="">here</a>.</p>

<p>I did not use any assets from their library because their License doesn&#8217;t allow me to share the Keynote files if I do.  However, I wanted to allow people to download my base library and hopefully help me improve my design.  The Keynote file can be found <a href="http://jkamenik.github.com/assets/Technical%20Debt%20Calculator.key">here</a>.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think, in the comments below.  In a later post I will talk about my findings.</p>

    <updated>2013-09-10T09:25:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2013/09/10/automator-workflow</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t like to repeat myself, and I use a Mac, so I have a great little tool called &#8220;Automator&#8221;.  Every morning when I am about to start work I open Spotlight (<code>cmd + space</code> for me) and type &#8220;startwork&#8221;.  The first app that shows up is my Automator workflow for opening all the programs that I need to work.</p>

<p>Here is my Automator workflow:</p>

<p><img src="http://jkamenik.github.com/images/start-work.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The apple script (The first action)</h2>

<p>This is a template apple script that just launches all my applications.</p>

<ol>
<li>Adium - An OS X chat client that can almost all IM protocols.</li>
<li>Waterfall Campfire - My company&#8217;s campfire chatroom isolated inside a Fluid app.</li>
<li>iTerm - My terminal of choice.</li>
<li>Tower - My git client of choice.</li>
<li>RubyMine - My IDE of choice.</li>
</ol>


<p><em>Note: I use &#8220;activate&#8221; with iTerm, because &#8220;launch&#8221; throws an error</em></p>

<h3>Assigning apps to desktops</h3>

<p>Automator cannot do this for you (at least not yet).  But I am very particular about where and how I like my windows setup.  Luckily the Mac remembers the last window settings on exit, so moving things around, resizing windows, and quitting does the trick.  However, it does <strong>not</strong> remember which screen an app is on.</p>

<p>To assign an app to open on a specific screen follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the app</li>
<li>Move the app to the screen you want (using mission control)</li>
<li>Switch to that screen</li>
<li>In the dock

<ol>
<li>Right click the application icon</li>
<li>Click Options -> Assign To -> This desktop</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p><em>Note: this only effects where the app opens, you can move windows to other screens anytime you want</em></p>

<h2>Opening URLs (Last 3 actions)</h2>

<p>The last three actions are the easiest way I can find to open multiple URLs in the same browser at once.  The automator task uses the system&#8217;s default browser which for me is Chrome.</p>

<p><em>Note: the URLs are opened in a semi-random order.  I don&#8217;t know how to fix that.</em></p>

<p>I like to open URLs as close to where I actually do my work as possible.  The trick is hacking the URLs.  These are the URLs that I use most.  Other URLs come and go - like right now where I open github.</p>

<ol>
<li>Pivotal Tracker - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/<code>project id</code>

<ol>
<li>I tend to work on a single project for long periods of time so I just open that project every time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Google Mail - https://mail.google.com/mail/u/<code>multi-login index</code>

<ol>
<li>The <code>/u/...</code> tells google to open a different logged in account.  I <em>always</em> log into my personal gmail account first (index 0) and my work account second.  So <code>/u/1</code> is my work email.</li>
<li>If you add <code>/u/...</code> but aren&#8217;t logged into google multiple times it will ask you to login again.  This can be jarring if you are not expecting it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Basecamp - https://basecamp.com/<code>account-id</code></li>

    <updated>2013-09-01T20:40:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2013/09/01/technical-debt-calculator</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All projects have some amount of Technical Debt.  And for projects I manage I am tired of keeping that knowledge in my brain.  My idea, and an example of UI mocking, is to create a technical debt calculator which can store the choices made on a project and map how those choice interfere with other choices.</p>

<p>The term Technical Debt refers to &#8220;any work that needs to be performed before a particular job can be complete.&#8221;  That is true, but I don&#8217;t like the wording.  Instead I am going to define it as &#8220;any choice that makes future progress more difficult or impossible&#8221;.</p>

<p>A project is defined by the choices.  Good or bad, every choice adds debt that must be juggled.  In fact, when a person is &#8220;in the know&#8221; that is referring to the fact that they know most-if-not-all the technical debt of a given project.  I find those people to be useful as a well of knowledge, but not as forward thinkers.</p>

<p>There is something about keeping all the Technical Debt knowledge that makes you adverse to change.  It isn&#8217;t technical debt that kills projects per se it is the keepers of technical debt that resist change that do.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My drive for this project is to not become a keeper-of-technical-debt on any project, and to communicate the debt clearly.  Often times when a project starts the time from talk to fully formed featured is hours or days.  1 - 3 years in and the same amount of effort is 1 to 2 days.  And on large projects that have taken several direct changes the time can be 1 to 2 weeks.  The only change being the number of previous choices.</p>

<h2>The good choices</h2>

<p>My calculator is meant only to track the bad choices or old choices.  There are some &#8220;good&#8221; choices that will slow forward progress, but ultimately prevent larger issues.  Here is a short list of something that will add time to the project but should NOT be considered technical debt:</p>

<ol>
<li>TDD/BDD</li>
<li>Agile methods</li>
<li>Using existing frameworks</li>
<li>QA</li>
<li>Code reviews</li>
<li>Local builds</li>
<li>Continuous integration</li>
<li>Saying &#8220;no&#8221;</li>
<li>Having confidence and a direction</li>
</ol>


<h2>Existing State</h2>

<p>I spend a little bit of time with pen and paper taking notes and drawling prototypes.  In the future I will expand on these ideas, but for how here they are in their raw form.</p>

    <updated>2013-08-29T08:47:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2013/08/29/using-keynote-for-mockups</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of UI mockup software out there.  I am sure they are good, but chances are that you already have exactly what you need.  I used to ominigraffle, which was fine.  And I know people that use Visio.  And there are a ton of UI Mocking software out there that costs a ton.</p>

<p>However, I have found presentation software (specifically Keynote) already has all the features you need for a good UI mockup.</p>

<p>Features of Keynote:</p>

<ol>
<li>Almost everyone knows how to create a presentation</li>
<li>$20 on the app store (that is not a sales price)</li>
<li>Presentation ready</li>
<li>Master slides, which allows

<ol>
<li>Crafting static backgrounds</li>
<li>Text placeholders</li>
<li>Custom guidelines</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Hidden slides

<ol>
<li>Allows for templating common items, but not showing them in the presentation</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Clickable elements

<ol>
<li>Allows simulating of a working UI.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<!-- more -->


<p>Here is my step by step for creating UI mockups.</p>

<h2>1. Use pen and paper</h2>

<p>Paper and Pen are the fastest way to get your ideas out of your head.  The other good thing about pen and paper is that you are not nessissarly constrained by UI medaphores built into a computer.  If you are trying to think of a better way to do something using a computer that is subtly forcing your into common UI patterns then that is the direction you will head.  You will not end up with anything better then before and you will likely have wasted a lot of time doing it.</p>

<p>Paper is supposed to be fast, not perfect.  So only use standard printer paper and a black pen.  Nothing more.</p>

<h3>1.1 Paper layout</h3>

<p>Fold the paper like <a href="http://jkamenik.github.com/images/paper_in_8s.jpg">this</a>.</p>

<p>This gives you 16 slides to play with (8 on each side).  Also, it roughly simulates landscape and portrait layout of a screen.  I recommend sacrificing one slide with a orientation arrow (point to the top of the sheet) and short title.  Definitely not a requirement, but it helps when you come back to these slides after a week.</p>

<h3>1.2. The shotgun</h3>

<p>Take part of the UI metaphor and shotgun different ideas on all 16 slides (15 if you want to keep a title).  Spend no more then 10minutes on it, or about 35s / slide.  All you are trying to do is come up with ideas on what might work.</p>

<p>After that spend some time on each slide deciding what does and does not work.  Cross out the complete failures.  Circle things you like.</p>

<p>Repeat this as much as you need to.</p>

<h3>1.3 Story-board</h3>

<p>If you are creating a multipart UI then take everything that worked and story-board out the progression.  Use only the elements that worked.  You might find that when story-boarded things, that you thought would work, don&#8217;t work.  There is not harm shotgunning some new ideas.</p>

<p>Each state of the UI is a single slide.  For example, if I am looking to demo a warning message when a user checks a checkbox then I would draw one frame with the button unchecked and no warning, and another with the button checked and a warning.  You can fill in the rest of the slides with other states or you can leave them blank.</p>

<h3>1.4 The reveal</h3>

<p>Don&#8217;t give a formal presentation.  Just show your slides and explain what you are trying to do.  Ideas will fly, so take notes.</p>

<p>One of two things will happen during the reveal: 1) the ideas are fine, but need a little work.  Or 2) everything about the idea is wrong.  If there are only minor tweaks then I recommend <strong>not</strong> redoing anything paper and instead moving on to more formal design.</p>

<p>If everything is wrong then stop now.  No harm, no foul.  You either didn&#8217;t have enough to go on, or your ideas weren&#8217;t clean.  Either way you only spent 10 to 20 minutes on something that was likely to fail anyway.  It probably best if the project is scrapped or rethought.</p>

<h3>How do I share paper with remote workers?</h3>

<p>Good question!  That is why white paper without lines, and a blank pen are so important.</p>

<p>You share the document by scanning it with a scanner (if you work in an office) or you take a picture of it with your smart phone!</p>

<h2>2. Setup a master document</h2>

<p>Keynote isn&#8217;t really meant for everyone to edit at the same time.  But you can create a master document which you share with the team so that everyone is on the same page.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start by creating a new document with the &#8220;White&#8221;.</li>
<li>Open the &#8220;Master Slides&#8221; menu: View -> Show Master Slides</li>
<li>Delete all the master slides except &#8220;Title &amp; subtitle&#8221; and &#8220;Blank&#8221;</li>
<li>Fill out the title slide</li>
</ol>


<h2>3. Template common elements</h2>

<p>At this point you should have a rough set of slides or a story-board and the basic master document.  You may have 10s or 100s of slides that need to be converted to digital, but before any of that create common UI elements.</p>

<p><a href="http://keynotopia.com/">http://keynotopia.com/</a> and things like it can be purchased to augment your UI collection.  Copy over or create the UI elements that are present in your story board.</p>

<p>Once you have a good set of common UI elements in one or two slides mark them skipped slide: Slide -> Skip slide.  This will let you later copy and paste elements but skip the slide during presentations.</p>

<h2>4. Create common backgrounds (using master slides)</h2>

<p>Just like creating common UI element, creating master slides lets you quickly throw together backgrounds.  More importantly editing the master slides causes every slide to update.</p>

<p>A master slide is just like a normal slide except that it can be used as the base for other sides.  For that reason anything that you put in a master side is not editable in a normal slide.  The exception is text which can be marked as a placeholder and changed in the slide.</p>

<p>I recommend building master slides in the following manner.</p>

<h3>4.1 Background object</h3>

<p>As a standard slide you can put any objects including shapes, and text.  The rule of thumb is to start with a recognizable background.  For websites that means creating something that looks like a web browser.  For a iPhone app create the outline of an iPhone.  For a computer program create common window.</p>

<p>Since these objects aren&#8217;t editable in slides you may find that you create quite a few master slides with different aspects of the project.  That is a good thing.  You master slides will ballon as your design balloons, which is another form of feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You may also want to create a slide that simulates scrolling to the middle or bottom of the page.  Just add a right scroll bar to the right at different positions: top, middle, bottom.</p>

<h3>4.2 Guides</h3>

<p>Once you have the master slide objects in place you will notice that the center of the usable area will not be centered the center of the slide.  This makes it difficult to position things on slides in a consistent way.  To make it easy again add guides.</p>

<p>Show the rulers: View -> Show Rulers.  Then grabbing the top ruler and dragging down will add a horizontal guide.  Grabbing the left ruler and dragging right will add a vertical guide.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> I add guides on the edges (like the sides of the iPhone screen).  Then I add guides in the middle.  Sometimes I will also add guides at the golden mean, or thirds, but never both at the same time.</p>

<h3>4.3 Placeholders</h3>

<p>Any text box can be a placeholder which means that the text can be modified on the slide.  When doing a website I make the browser title and URL bar a placeholder.</p>

<p>To create a placeholder first add a &#8220;Text box&#8221;, place it where you want, and give it a good default value.  With the item selected open the <strong>Inspector</strong> and go to the <em>Master Slide</em> tab.  Check &#8220;Define as Text Placeholder&#8221; and give it a unique name.</p>

<p>A slide can modify a placeholder in any way it needs to.  This includes changing size, position, or even deleting the item entirely.  But it is a really good way to add quickly configurable defaults.</p>

<h2>5. Create UI (using slides)</h2>

<p>With the master slides and templates in place it is a simple matter to create slides.  A slide should contain no more then would fit on a single screen; remember presentation slides don&#8217;t scroll.  If you need a multipage slide split it over 2 or 3 slides.</p>

<p>Do not try to make the screen interactive.  That is not the purpose of a presentation.  Stick with duplicating the paper slides.</p>

<h2>6. Create interaction (using clickable items)</h2>

<p>You could stop at step 5 and give a pretty great presentation, but sometimes you really want to take things over the top.  Keynote allows you to make objects hyperlinks, which can link to another slide, a webpage, or another presentation.</p>

<p>In the design view there is a visual clue that the item is clickable, but not during the presentation.  And since hyperlinks can jump forward or backwards in the presentation this feature can get you into a lot of trouble.  It is very important that the entire presentation be closed to finished before adding hyperlinks.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To help you stay out of trouble, duplicate a slide and only change one item.  Then link from the first slide to the second in a way that makes sense, and be sure to link from the second back to the first.  Resist the urge to have the second slide link anywhere but to the first slide.</p>

<h2>7. Don&#8217;t Add details</h2>

<p>You can spend hours adding details which will either need to be completely removed and redone or will be ignored.  The goal is to provide enough fidelity to be useful but not enough detail to reach the &#8220;uncanny valley&#8221; of sorts.  If the fidelity of the design is too high then people start picking apart the details, and stop thinking about the presentation.</p>

<h3>Uncanny Valley</h3>

<p>This is a term borrowed from the field of human aesthetics that states &#8220;[it] is the region of negative emotional response towards robots that seem &#8216;almost human&#8217;&#8221;.  See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">wikipedia article</a> for details.</p>

<p>The issue doesn&#8217;t stop with humans judging humans, it takes place anytime a human judges something that seems familiar.  Especially computer programs.  Basically, as we add detail there is a point right before &#8220;perfect&#8221; which is so bad that it is worse then if stopped at the hand drawings.</p>

<ol>
<li>Nothing -> neutral</li>
<li>Drawings -> good</li>
<li>Keynote -> better</li>
<li>Keynote with details -> <strong>HORRIBLE!!!!</strong></li>
<li>Actual implementation -> best</li>
</ol>

<p>The issue was that I know pretty much everything about the feature I implemented, so I would just go at it.  I would often get confused, start over, or go off on a tangent.  By the end everything took longer then it should, and wasn&#8217;t as good as it should have been.  Over all very frustrating.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why I didn&#8217;t think about this sooner and why this isn&#8217;t the first thing people tell when you start doing screencasts, but start with a screenplay.  The movie industry has decades of experience and they start each movie with a pitch and a screenplay.</p>

<p>Think of a screenplay like a wireframe for your video.  Everything about them is about making things simple to understand.  Below is a simplified version of <a href="http://2012.scriptfrenzy.org/howtoformatascreenplay">the screenplay format</a> applied specifically to screencasts.</p>

<p>I have a sample Google doc file <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tstVIrAOQlfjjttxyjK_igDmrrIFf4IYuHhNJQljOQY/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2013/07/24/foundation/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-24T20:34:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2013/07/24/foundation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> is a UI library which aims to simplify design by starting with a responsive library.  It is very similar to Twitter Bootstrap, but since it uses SCSS it should fit better within Rails.</p>

<p>The demo for what I have done is <a href="http://jkamenik.github.io/waterfall-foundation">here</a></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It would be accurate to say that I have a little crush on this framework.  In my day to day I have to deal with Drupal Designers.  They are not bad people to be sure, and the designs they come up with are great.  But there is no structure to what they provide.  They are painting using waterfall colors on a still pond.  The stuff they come up with is amazing, but if you do anything but look at it all is lost.</p>

<p>Foundation is an apt name because it offer an underlying structure to design.  It has opinions, but as a Rails guy I am used to that.  More importantly the opinions are those of designers, but with a structure that resonates with developers.  So not being a designer I can still develop a decent UI.</p>

<h2>The downside</h2>

<p>First the downside, it doesn&#8217;t support IE lower then 8 and only partially supports IE8.  That isn&#8217;t a huge issue for me, but it does make it difficult to use commercially.  Other then that I don&#8217;t see any issues.</p>

<h2>The grid</h2>

<p>Foundation uses a 12 column grid system to control the layout of elements.  12 is great measure because it divides by 2, 3, 4, and 6.  It also supports the nesting of grid rows within columns.</p>

<h3>Large / Medium / Small</h3>

<p>When defining columns you can give it a span by adding the column count like &#8220;large-9&#8221;.  Just so long as counts add to 12 everything works.  But what is awesome is that each column can be different based on screen size.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;small-6 medium-7 large-9&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This causes the div to be 6 columns when the screen is small, 7 for medium screens, and 9 for large screens.</p>

<h3>Push / Pull</h3>

<p>Add &#8220;push-X&#8221; cause a column to pad left by the number of columns.  &#8220;small-9 push-3&#8221; means the column is 9 wide and moved over by 3 columns, basically making it the last column even if in the html it is first.</p>

<p>&#8220;pull-X&#8221; does the opposite and moves a column to the right.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;small-9 push-3&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Last on screen, first in HTML.<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;small-3 pull-9&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>First on screen, last in HTML.<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Show / Hide</h3>

<p>Adding &#8220;show-for-X&#8221; will cause the div to be hidden unless the screen is the correct size.  There is a &#8220;hide-for-X&#8221; as well.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;show-for-small&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Shown only if small<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Semantic HTML</h2>

<p>Foundation uses semantic HTML in order achieve a responsive design.  And hence why IE7 and below are not supported and IE8 is only partially supported.  But semantic HTML plays very well with the mobile web and makes the HTML easier to code and maintain.</p>

<h2>The Widgets</h2>

<p>Along with the opinions come standardized UI widgets.  It isn&#8217;t on the same level as a GUI toolkit like ExtJS, but all the basic HTML behaviors are there plus a lot of other nice items.</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>A &#8220;nav&#8221; element acts as a standard menu with dropdowns on a desktop.  In a mobile browser it becomes a set of clickable links that sweep left.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h3>Panels / Flash</h3>

<p>These can be used to display a &#8220;block&#8221; of text.  They have some standard highlights like &#8220;alert&#8221; which makes them good for flash messages.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Joyride</h3>

<p>A joyride lets you highlight elements on the page with some descriptive text.  It is as simple creating a unordered list with the class &#8220;joyride-list&#8221;.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to add a Table Of Contents (TOC) to some of my longer blog entries.  Here is how I did it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Full credit it due to a google search which turned up this <a href="https://github.com/bmc/brizzled/blob/master/source/_posts/2012-02-04-generating-a-table-of-contents-in-octopress.markdown">https://github.com/bmc/brizzled/blob/master/source/_posts/2012-02-04-generating-a-table-of-contents-in-octopress.markdown</a>.</p>

<p>I followed it to get an idea of what I wanted, but diverged a lot.  What I wanted was:</p>

<ol>
<li>The TOC to be driven by a <code>toc: true</code> in the YML front matter of any page</li>
<li>The TOC to be the first item in the sidebar.</li>
<li>The TOC to contain only the h2 tags and below (Ignoring the H1 page title)</li>
</ol>


<h2>1. Add JS TOC code</h2>

<p>Download the <a href="http://fuelyourcoding.com/scripts/toc/">jQuery TOC plugin</a> and move the js file into javascripts directory.</p>

<p>Add the following code to the head.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>_includes/custom/head.html</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.1.min.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;/javascripts/jquery.tableofcontents.min.js&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;/javascripts/generate-toc.js&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This downloads jQuery from a CDN, loads the TOC plugin and will eventually load our driver code.</p>

<h2>2. Write the driver and trigger code</h2>

<p>Create the driver code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>javascripts/generate-toc.js</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>

<p>The <code>page</code> variable is the YML front mater hash so we can check for <code>toc</code> to ensure the trigger code is only included on pages that want a TOC.</p>

<h2>3. Adjust the generators</h2>

<p><code>rake new_post</code> and <code>rake new_page</code> generate a stub page with some YML head matter so it make sense for me to adjust the generators to include <code>toc</code>.</p>

<p>Just add something like this to the <code>Rakefile</code>:</p>

    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2013/07/06/blog-changes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My last blog entry was when my son was born.  A perfect reason for a blog entry, but I had fully intended to keep blogging and just didn&#8217;t find the time.  Turns out the issue isn&#8217;t really that I don&#8217;t have the time, but that I don&#8217;t have the time write the really involved articles.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There is nothing wrong with a fully detailed article, when the time permits.  However, I have a great many partially started articles that still need hours of research and development to finish.  My previous process something like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find a concept</li>
<li>Initial research</li>
<li>Outline</li>
<li>Code spike / actual developement</li>
<li>Refactoring</li>
<li>Final code (something to be reasonably proud of)</li>
<li>Start the blog</li>
<li>More research</li>
<li>Final blog</li>
<li>Proof read - Send to editor</li>
<li>Publish blog</li>
</ol>


<p>Clearly, way to involved to involved to do every week with the time I do have.  The new goal is eposodic entries that may not be fully formed, but would eventually lead to a fully formed article.  To that end I have codified my goals (more as a ways to keep myself inline) <a href="http://jkamenik.github.com/blog-goals">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Knowledge / Continously updated pages</h2>

<p>In addition to adjusting the way I blog I am also going to move continously updated content out of blog entries and into individual pages.  The <a href="http://jkamenik.github.com/knowledge">Knowledge</a> section of the blog is dedicated for these.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Comcast 30 day challenge fails, except in challenging my nerves!</p>

<p>I feel angry and scammed, but instead of ranting I am just going to give the timeline with some commentaries.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Everything below is factually accurate, but for libel reasons I will be leaving out the name of persons involved, as well as specific locations.  The place where initial contact was made will be known as &#8220;the mall&#8221;, the sales agent as &#8220;A&#8221;, the installation tech as &#8220;the tech&#8221;, Comcast support will be known as &#8220;S1&#8221; and &#8220;S2&#8221;, and the equipment recovery support will be known as &#8220;R1&#8221; and &#8220;R2&#8221;.</p>

<p><code>My commentary will have this format.</code></p>

<h3>Final Outcome</h3>

<p>Lets start with the final outcome, which was effectively a 3 hour no-op.  There is a lot of anger because we feel duped, but no money changed hands, and I was able to reset my previous service provider without incident.  There is loss of recorded programs on the DVR, but that is the only loss I have suffered.</p>

<p>I suffered 2 days (of the free 30) with the wrong services and a constant set of &#8220;we can&#8217;t help you.  Talk to some one else&#8221; answers.  During that time the internet (though not the correct server) had several outages.</p>

<h3>Timeline</h3>

<h4>November - June - Worry sets in</h4>

<p>Worrying about money and the cost all subscription services.  Verizon isn&#8217;t horrible at $116 / month for very stable internet and some HD channels, but other then mortgage and utilities it our single greatest monthly expense.  We don&#8217;t have movie channels because we have both NetFlix and Amazon Prime.</p>

<p>I am out of contract with Verizon so my cost could jump at any time, but at least I am not locked into a 2 year contract.  Doing online research has not yielded any options that are better.</p>

<h4>Early June - Small changes</h4>

<p>Cancel NetFlix since we barely watch it and have amazon which offers streaming video as well.</p>

<h4>June 5th, 2013 - Sign up</h4>

<p>Wednesday was a rough day and we decided to go to the mall to eat dinner.  After dinner we walked the mall and ended up in a Big Box store.  We were looking at the $199 Chromebook when <strong>A</strong> approached us.</p>

<p><code>Yes we are a emotional eaters.</code></p>

<p><strong>A</strong> was quite nice and we have been looking for a cheaper service anyway.  He tells us about the &#8220;$400 per year challenge&#8221; where comcast can save you over $400 a year with the same or better service.  After discussing what we have, he tells us about the package he has for $72 / month for 1 year.  The package is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Digital Preferred Plus TV</li>
<li>50mb / s Internet</li>
<li>HBO, Showtime and Max</li>
</ul>


<p><code>Sounds too good to be true.  We are sceptical.</code></p>

<p><strong>A</strong> then says that we don&#8217;t have to pay for anything now and we get to try it for 30 days for free.  We sign up for installation Tuesday afternoon.  He takes the form and returns with the brochure which he writes on.</p>

<p><code>What the hell.  If it works, great.  If not it isn't going to cost us anything.</code></p>

<p>On the drive home we get a text from <strong>A</strong> asking when we wanted the installation.</p>

<p><code>Now I am on guard.  This seems like all the old problems I have had with Comcast.  Memories of bad service, and bad support come flooding back.</code></p>

<h4>June 10th, 2013 - Red flags</h4>

<p>We get a welcome package from Comcast and it has nothing in it that remotely looks like what we were told about.  The advertised packages were triple play and much more then we are willing to pay.</p>

<p><code>Red flag 1.</code></p>

<p>Later that night I get my confirmation call.  The call says that the install will &#8220;arrive between 8am and 10am&#8221;.</p>

<p><code>Red flag 2.</code></p>

<h4>June 11th, 2013 - The install</h4>

<p><code>I work from home.  So I am always there during the day.  I rearrange things so that I won't need the internet.</code></p>

<p>Around 8:30am the tech arrives.  He walks around the yard examining things then comes to the door.  He asks if I have ever had Comcast.  &#8220;Not at this address&#8221;.  He tells me that there is no line to the house so he going to have to check some things.  He comes back a few minutes later and says that the only option is to run a cable over the driveway, and across the yard and later they will run an underground line.  I have to sign a waiver because it is a tripping hazard.</p>

<p><code>I figured he was going to try to take the cable directly through a wall like happened at another house.  So I am happy to sign the waiver.</code></p>

<p><code>Remember that they schedule an appointment to bury the line.  It comes up later.</code></p>

<p>Tech runs the outside line and connects it to the line that already goes into the house.  Then comes in saying &#8220;I have a DVR, digital receiver, and cable modem where do you want them&#8221;.  I say &#8220;The DVR in the living room, the modem in the laundry room.&#8221;  He asks &#8220;where is the other TV?&#8221;</p>

<p><code>Red flag 3.  I anly have 1 TV, and **A** knew that.</code></p>

<p>Tech says &#8220;You should call your sales guy.  Service order says I have to install 2 TVs.&#8221;  <strong>A</strong> warned me to txt him before calling in case he was with a client.  So that is that what I do.  Meanwhile the tech installs the cable box, which has to update.  Then he goes about installing the modem.</p>

<p><code>Awesome, soon I get my internet back.  I have been working without it, using my phone for email and other things that require me to be connected.  Soon I will be able to push what I have done to github.</code></p>

<p>Tech installs the cable modem and needs a computer to activate it.  He uses a spare machine I have.  It installs a bunch of packages like always, which I can&#8217;t risk infecting my work computer.</p>

<p><code>I hate that Comcast has this as a requirement, but at least I have a work around.  Verizon had a similar policy, but I was in the middle of moving and didn't have a computer so their tech used a verizon laptop to complete the installation.  No such luck with Comcast so it was a good thing I had a spare laptop.</code></p>

<p>Immediately after configuring internet I check my work machine.  It is able to connect, but can&#8217;t get online.  After 5 min of debugging it suddenly works.</p>

<p><code>Checking the modem logs the next day I found that the DHCP server kept crashing, which explains why machine was on Wifi but couldn't talk to anything.</code></p>

<p>Checking speedtest.net I find that I am only getting 20mb /s down.  I tell the tech it should be 50mb.  He says &#8220;you need to call your sales guy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then heads back to check the cable box.  Asks &#8220;what service do you have&#8221;?  &#8220;Digital Perferred Plus&#8221;.  His response &#8220;Oh well that&#8217;s not what is enabled on this box.  You should call your sales man and get this correct.  There is nothing I can do.  I could call support but they might not be able to help, but it would cost you.&#8221;</p>

<p><code>Wait what!?!  Support at comcast costs money now, and they can't help you with problems?</code></p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t gotten a response back from <strong>A</strong> so I give him an actual call.  The phone goes to voice mail and the voice says &#8220;the user has not setup their voicemail, goodbye&#8221;.</p>

<p><code>Red flag 4.  Holy hell!  A salesman that can't be reach and Comcast unable to help.  F'</code></p>

<p>About 10 minutes later I get a call back and explain the situation.  The tech is doing cleanup so he is still here.  <strong>A</strong> tells me to have him take back the spare tuner and he will correct service tomorrow.</p>

<p><code>Not what I want to hear, but at least things will be corrected soon.</code></p>

<h4>June 12th, 2013 - The fail</h4>

<p><strong>7:30ish</strong> - I start work and try speedtest.net again.  Still 20mb.  <strong>A</strong> must not be at work yet.</p>

<p><strong>10:50ish</strong> - The internet goes out for about 10 minutes.  Great.  <strong>A</strong> corrected my account.  <code>or so I thought</code></p>

<p><strong>11am</strong> - Internet comes back so I check speedtest.net.  Still 20mb.  <code>WTF?!? Less then one day in and I am already have network outages?</code></p>

<p><strong>11:03am</strong> - I txt <strong>A</strong> &#8220;Any word on getting my package corrected?&#8221;.  I then go about figuring out why the Internet went out.  From the modem logs it appears the DHCP (needed for computer to talk to the internet) crashed.  The time wasn&#8217;t exactly right, but modem timestamp might not be accurate so that is my best guess.</p>

<p><strong>4:10pm</strong> - I txt <strong>A</strong> &#8220;4pm and still word nor is the service working correctly&#8221;.  Then realize my mistaken and txt &#8220;Still no word*&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>6:50pm</strong> - I call Comcast back on a number they called me from after the appointment.  Turns out that is just the survey line and they can&#8217;t transfer me.  They give me an alternate number, but that is the best they can do.</p>

<p><strong>6:52pm</strong> - I Comcast at the number provided.  A few menus later and a short wait I am talking to retainment agent <strong>S1</strong> about canceling service.  I explain the situation and she wants to see if she can correct my service before canceling.  I am on hold for about 10minutes when she comes back to tell me that I have to talk to my sales person.</p>

<p><code>Now I am thinking that I need to talk to the sales person to cancel.  Crap!</code></p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get ahold of him.  Just cancel the service.&#8221;  <strong>S1</strong> says &#8220;sorry for all the problem we can certainly cancel your account.  Since you are in the 30day window there will be no charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>A short wait later <strong>S1</strong> says &#8220;You service is now canceled.  Do you have any questions at this time?&#8221;  &#8220;Are you going to send me a box so that I can return the equipment.&#8221;  She says &#8220;No, but I can redirect you to a recovery agent.&#8221;</p>

<p><code>Crap.  I have been on the phone for more then an hour and now I have to talk to someone else.</code></p>

<p>Another short wait and now I am talking to <strong>R1</strong>.  For verification reasons I have tell her all my account details.  Then she says &#8220;I am sorry, but we cannot collect your equipment Comcast has you down for a service call in 2 weeks so until that is finished there is nothing I can do&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; I say.  &#8220;I literally just got done canceling and was redirected here.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>R1</strong> says &#8220;I am sorry sir, but we are not Comcast.  We are a 3rd party.  You need to call Comcast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine, please transfer me back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry sir I cannot do that.  You have to call them back yourself.&#8221;  So I hung up.</p>

<p><code>Now I question if Comcast is a company or a loose collection of people whose job it is to bounce you around like ping pong balls.  Have I even been talking to Comcast?</code></p>

<p><strong>7:15pm</strong> - I call Comcast back, wait again, and go through the same verification as before.  Now I am with <strong>S2</strong> who just like <strong>S1</strong> attempts correct my service and will not help until she does.  I give her all the details.  She says &#8220;Sir that is not a package that we offer.  What I can do is waive the DVR for a year and give you HBO and your cost is only $89.99 / month&#8221;.</p>

<p><code>Oh hell no.  I was sold $72 all in, no contract, including 3 movie channels.  Now I am being switched to a waived DRV (read contract required) and less for more?</code></p>

<p>I say &#8220;No that is worse then I was sold.  But I already canceled the service and at recovery they told me they could collect because I had an outstanding appointment.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>S2</strong> says &#8220;Let me check&#8230;  I see they have an appointment in 2 weeks to bury a line, but&#8221;  I cut her off &#8220;but since I canceled there isn&#8217;t a need to bury a line.  Can you please cancel that appointment so I can have my equipment collected?&#8221;</p>

<p><code>I shouldn't have cut her off, but it has been almost 2 hours of being bounced around and no one can help me completely and accurately.  I need to start being clear and not giving openings because I still have to make dinner.</code></p>

<p><strong>S2</strong> says &#8220;Ok sir.  We can cancel that appointment.  If that is all I can transfer you back to recovery.  Have a nice day.&#8221;</p>

<p>A short wait, and re-verification of my account later I am talking to <strong>R2</strong>.  She ask when I would like someone to pickup the stuff.  So I schedule it and hang up.</p>

<p><strong>7:30pm</strong> - I disconnect the Comcast line to the house and reconnect the Verizon line.  I then pull out all the Comcast parts and replace them with my Verizon equipment.  I leave the Comcast DVR because we taped a several things yesterday that we want to watch and collections isn&#8217;t for several days.</p>

<p><code>When we tried the DVR later it was bricked by corporate.  Nothing worked.  So those shows are lost to us now.  Thank god for online streaming.</code></p>

<p><strong>7:42pm</strong> - I text <strong>A</strong> &#8220;No worries.  Several calls to support later.  Comcast is canceled&#8221;.  I then start writing this blog.</p>

<h2>Our Experience</h2>

<p><strong>12:30am</strong> Melanie starts labor, but can&#8217;t wake me up.  It didn&#8217;t even dawn on me that it could have been actual labor.  In my defense I am a heavy sleeper so it was difficult to get me up.</p>

<p><strong>2am</strong> Melanie was able to get me fully awake.  I was still unsure what was happening, so I wanted to time the contractions.  Having gone to the labor class I knew that we needed to time contractions: 511, 5 minutes apart, for a 1 minute duration, for 1 hour.  I also knew that false labor, which can sometimes be very painful, proceeds real labor but up to several weeks.</p>

<p><strong>2:20am</strong> We are DONE timing contractions!  Or rather my continuing health demands we stop timing contractions.  The contractions have Mel on the floor with back labor, and she is going to kill me.  Under explicit instructions, tears, and anger I call the on-call Doctor on Mel&#8217;s behalf.</p>

<p><strong>2:40am</strong> We are at the Hospital and Mel is headed to Triage.  I get to wait in the labor waiting room until they have checked her and decide to admit her.</p>

<p><strong>3:00am</strong> We are in the labor rooms.  Very nice and roomy and private to each labor.  Big enough for a couch (where I was sleeping) several chairs, the labor bed, the baby examination table/heater, sink, bathroom, and medical supply room.  Right now it is a waiting game of doctor checks.</p>

<p><strong>5am</strong> Mel gets the epidural.  It is a sterile procedure so I had to wait in the waiting area again.  It takes just under an hour and 2 attempts to get the epidural in correctly.</p>

<p><strong>6am</strong> We start posting updates to friends and family.  We figured it was nicer to wait until at least a standard start of the day and not send the invites at 3am when we were actually admitted.  Mel&#8217;s pain is much less, but so is the strength of the her contractions.  Now her progression has to be monitored more closely, and pitocin administered if needed.</p>

<p><strong>7:30am</strong> Mel has progressed to 7-8cm so we tell her parents to head down.</p>

<p><strong>8am</strong> Mel&#8217;s water is broken by the doctor, but she is still progressing.  No need for pitocin, yet.</p>

<p><strong>9am</strong> Mel&#8217;s parents are here.  And she is progression nicely to 9cm.</p>

<p><strong>10am</strong> Francis is still at 0 station.  He has engaged, but is not progressing.  We are on a watch because the contractions are not constant.</p>

<p><strong>10:30am</strong> Francis heart rate dropped below safe rate and immediately above safe range.  The external monitors are removed and internal monitors added in hopes that the blips were Mel&#8217;s movements and not the actual measurements of the baby.</p>

<p><strong>11am</strong> The new monitors are MUCH more painful, since the vagina is not numbed by the epidural, but she endures.  Also, the progression has stopped, and Francis continues to have heart flutters.  And Mel&#8217;s own blood pressure is setting off alarms right and left.  We are given the option to start pitocin, wait things out, or as the doctor recommends start talking about a C-Section.</p>

<p><strong>11:15am</strong> We had already decided that if something like this happened we were OK with the C-Section.  Mel is terrified of surgery, since she has never had surgery.  Her mother, having had 2 C-Sections, gives her the low down on what it is like.  That, knowing I will be there, knowing they will block her pain, and knowing she will be awake is enough for us to move forward.</p>

<p><strong>11:45am</strong> All the extra sensors are removed, she is in the OR, and I am sitting in the recovery room waiting to be called in.</p>

<p><strong>12pm</strong> In the OR with Mel, Doctor has made the first cut.</p>

<p><strong>12:48pm</strong> Francis is pulled out and immediately begins crying.  Normally this is great but in our case there is meconium in the amniotic fluid, so we don&#8217;t want him to aspirate it.  So the peditritians take him immediately to the examanation table.  All is fine now, but we have to watch him carefully over the next few days.  It is possible for him to develop a lung infection.</p>

<p><strong>+3 days</strong> We are heading home, Francis is fine.</p>

<h2>What we have learned</h2>

<ul>
<li>Opinions due little but sully the otherwise very special moment</li>
<li>Nothing goes as planned</li>
<li>Babies have an inverted sleep schedule</li>
<li>Breastfeeding is f&#8217;n hard!</li>
<li>Breasts are purely functional</li>
<li>Nipple confusion is a much smaller concern then it seems</li>
<li>The &#8220;connection&#8221; is not instantainious for all women</li>
<li>&#8220;Baby amnesia&#8221; comes along slowly</li>
<li>You never have enough diapers</li>
</ul>


<h3>Opinions</h3>

<p>Facts are great, and even talking about experiences are nice.  But spouting opinions sucks, and we have been inundated.  Here are just a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Circumcision is mutilation and has a good change so killing your boy:</em> <strong>false</strong>.  Very little of this is factually actuate, but it is spouted with such fervor as to be unquestionable.  If you want your boy circumcised then do, if you don&#8217;t that is fine to.  Make the choice and ignore all detractors.</li>
<li><em>Breastfeeding is </em>always<em> better then formula:</em> <strong>false</strong>.  There are benefits and drawbacks for both breastfeeding and formula.  We choose breastfeeding, but think nothing less of women that choose formula.  You have to pick what is right for you.</li>
<li><em>Never use a pacifier/bottle when breastfeeding:</em> <strong>false</strong>.  We have tried a bottle, and continue to use a pacifier and have no problem with nipple confusion.  Do what is right for your baby, your life, and you; the rest will take care of itself.</li>
<li><em>Epidural are selfish, bad, you will have problems:</em> <strong>false</strong>.  Just not true.  Mel wanted a natural birth, but when the pain of back labor was too much the epidural was needed.</li>
<li><em>Labor is a beautiful things:</em> semi-<strong>false</strong>.  I can see why it is though of as beautiful, and at the highest level it is.  But in the details of the pain, strain, lack of sleep, frustration, fear, and expectation it is more real then beautiful.  The rememberance of Labor will be beautiful - I am sure - but right now things are real.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Nothing goes as planned</h3>

<p>During our planning class the nurse suggested that we &#8220;let the baby drive&#8221;.  Basically do not create a written list, because you will stress over details before labor and when things do not go as planned it will add fuel to the baby blues after labor.</p>

<p>In our case we had a general plan and almost nothing worked out as we wanted.  In the end we had a healthy baby boy and the plan of not planning worked out pretty well.</p>

<h3>Babies sleep during the day</h3>

<p>There are many guesses as to why this is, but basically once born they sleep all day and are awake at night.  Francis was born in the middle of the day, and was nearly impossible to wake up for the first 24 hours.  His bladder and bowels worked fine, so the doctors were not concerned.  In fact, almost a week later and it is still almost impossible to wake Francis after a good feeding during the day, and impossible to get him to sleep after a good feeding during the night.</p>

<p>Right now the only things we can do is keep playing with him during the day (to the point of annoyance), and ignore him at night.  By &#8220;ignore&#8221; all I mean is we can&#8217;t make eye contact, talk to him, pet him, or talk to him (yes I said it twice).  We still pat him to burp him, shush, and bounce him to aid in sleeping, but nothing else.  Easier said then done, but we persist.</p>

<h3>Breastfeeding is hard</h3>

<p>One of the major opinions that is implicitly or explicitly stated is that every baby MUST be breastfed.  And as a women it should be the most natural thing in the world.  Guess what?  It&#8217;s not.</p>

<p>Babies do not know how to breastfeed, and more importantly they do not want to breastfeed.  They spend 9 months being given food with no work, but now they have to work for food.  And they have to work hard!</p>

<p>Worst still a women&#8217;s breast must change to make breastfeeding possible.  So even if the want is there it is very frustrating for many days/weeks.  And sometimes it will never be possible.  In our case we have to use a Nipple Shield to start the feedings because the nipples are flat and Francis doesn&#8217;t know to start sucking.</p>

<h3>Breasts are purely functional</h3>

<p>When we were in the hospital there were no less then 20 people help Mel and I breastfeed Francis, and there was nothing weird about it.  We both thought of it only in terms of what gets Francis food.</p>

<p>Even now we don&#8217;t bother drawing the curtains when breastfeeding.  There just isn&#8217;t anything weird about having a breast hanging out in prep for breastfeeding, nor is there anything sexual about it.  They have a single purpose, which is as a food supply.</p>

<p>It is the equivalent of getting aroused by a hamburger; just not something that happens (normally).</p>

<h3>Nipple confusion</h3>

<p>I guess we made the mistake of telling the doctors that we planned on breastfeeding.  The reason that I said &#8220;mistake&#8221; is because &#8220;nipple confusion&#8221; is such a pervasive argument that they removed all formula, bottles, and pacifiers that are normally provided after labor.</p>

<p>In fact, on one night it took us and several nurses over 6 hours to get just 1/2 oz of colostrum into Francis.  And during all that time breastfeeding was the only option.  It was horrible.</p>

<p>The lactation consultant seeing the medical necessity did eventually give us a breast pump, and pacifier, but no bottle.  We had to use a syringe to provide colostrum through a tube next to a finger that simulated a nipple.</p>

<p>It took a several complete feeding failures, and finally giving Francis to the nurses so we could sleep, to just get him some formula.  In fact, we weren&#8217;t allow to feed him the formula, only the nurses could and only because they could not get him satisfied otherwise.</p>

<p>It has been almost a month, we use pacifies, use bottles, and the breast and we can safely say that he has no nipple confusion.  Perhaps it is something that affects only some babies, or it is something that really hasn&#8217;t been studies and is just take as fact.</p>

<h3>The &#8220;Connection&#8221;</h3>

<p>This seems to me like the female equivalent of &#8220;comparing sizes&#8221;.  When asked women almost universally say &#8220;it was instantaneous&#8221;, or something similar.  And I am sure 3 to 6 years after labor when first asked it seems instantaneous, but it is not for some women.</p>

<p>The &#8220;connection&#8221; is real, but it takes many days, even a week or more before it really kicks in.  And assuming that <strong>all</strong> women have an instantaneous connection really just adds fuel to the baby blues.</p>

<h3>&#8220;Baby Amnesia&#8221;</h3>

<p>It has been about a month and the baby amnesia is just now starting to kicked in.  It is definiately not as originally discribed: a clam that washes over you.  It is not instantaneous.</p>

<p>Basically what happens (at least for us) is you start forgetting the details, pain, and difficulty.  And you also start to realize exactly how much you can actually deal with.  And Francis is quite, content, and smiles and you realize how awesome it is.</p>

<h3>Diapers</h3>

<p>An infant eats every 2 hours to 3 hours during the day, and 2 to 5 hours during the night.  And they pee and poop between feedings.  You would think that 12 diapers / day is about average, but it isn&#8217;t.  As adults we have learned to urinate and defecate during the same bathroom trip.  the same is not of babies.  For them they will urinate and defecate as two separate acts, and to prevent diaper rash you have to change them between each act.  That doesn&#8217;t even account for the partial pee/poop, in which they start pee or poop as soon as you take the diaper off.  And in a lot of cases they will pee or poop as soon as you get the diaper back on; and in some cases do it 3 or 4 times in a single changing.</p>

<p>24 to 30 diapers / day is closer to accurate.</p>

<h2>Why leave the comment below?</h2>

<p>So a number of people have asked me why I left the comment below.  It is rude, and it is hurtful to have someone try to sully the birth of my child with &#8220;yet more opinions&#8221;.</p>

<p>In fact, this type of comment is EXACTLY what I was talking about in the &#8220;What we have learned&#8221; section.  Just for fun I have turned my post and her comment into a conversation.  Hopefully it shows how ridiculous the comment is, and why I think it is important to leave up.</p>

<p><em>me:</em> Opinions suck! They lead to a lot of mis-information.</p>

<p><em>jane:</em> No <strong>your</strong> opinions suck.  Mine opinions are actually FACT!</p>

<p><em>me:</em> Turns out that Epidurals are sometimes necessary for hard deliveries.</p>

<p><em>jane:</em> No, they <strong>are</strong> selfish!  With my first child I had a beautiful natural birth.  With the second I <strong>had</strong> to have a epidural and there were nothing but problems.  As you can see clearly, it was the epidurals fault.  But I am not downing epidurals.</p>

<p><em>me:</em> Breastfeeding is hard.  Frankie wants to do it, but has such a bad overbite that he can&#8217;t lock.  We have had repeated visits from the Lactation consultant and every nurse on the floor has tried to help us, but still nothing.  He is loosing weight and all we want is to get something in him.  Everyone tells us that nipple confusion can happen, but for christ sake lets get at least a little food into Frankie.</p>

<p><em>jane:</em> Babies want to breastfeed, and I also had some trouble.  I had to things like pull out my nipple before each feeding.  Clearly you guys are lazy and stupid!  You need to try harder.  Also, your are wrong nipple confusion <strong>CAN</strong> happen!</p>

<p><em>me:</em> I didn&#8217;t say nipple confusion doesn&#8217;t happen.  What I was saying was that we were told that nipple confusion was instantaneous.  Put your baby on the bottle once and that is all-she-wrote.  That is not the case with Frankie, but never mind you aren&#8217;t listening anyway.</p>

<p><em>jane:</em> Also, circumcised boys <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> breastfeed so you are double stupid!</p>

<p><em>me:</em> Wait, what?  I never said one or the other that I circumcised Frankie.</p>

<p><em>jane:</em> Well it doesn&#8217;t matter.  From the way you talk it is clear that you did.  I read part of your above story, judged your entire life, and walked through all the bad choices you made (entirely within my mind).  I started writing this comment to educate you, so that your child won&#8217;t be a serial killer.  Because &#8220;scientific evidence&#8221; shows that <strong>ALL</strong> serial killers were bottle fed!</p>

<p><em>me:</em> (eyes glazed over)</p>
