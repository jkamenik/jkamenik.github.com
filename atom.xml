    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jekyll supports unpublished posts, but Octopress does not make it clear.  This is how I fixed that for my own blog.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Octopress actually does support &#8220;published: false&#8221; in the front matter.  And because it based on Jekyll it means that those posts will be available in &#8220;preview&#8221; but will be ignored when the site is generated/published.</p>

<p>My main care is that I know what I can do with a post in 3 to 4 months.  So I added the the published flag to the generated frontmatter of every new post.</p>

<p>I also had to update <code>rake push</code> to regenerate the full site before deployment.  This is because preview works on the same directly that is copied to production.  And since you can preview unpublished posts they will be visible in production, unless you run <code>rake generate</code> first.</p>

<p>Additionally I want to know visually when a page is a draft.  For that I add &#8220;Draft: &#8221; to the title.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>_includes/article.html</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you will see &#8220;Draft: &#8221; in front of any unpublished posts.</p>

<h2>Manual management</h2>

<p>A few additional things I like to do, but I haven&#8217;t automated yet are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add &#8220;-draft&#8221; to the file name.</li>
<li>Change the publish date to the day I publish the article

<ol>
<li>This involves changing the file name as well as the front matter</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

    <updated>2014-01-10T15:07:00-05:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>RBAC stands for <em>Role Based Access Control</em>.  It is basically a means to programmitically configure access rights without hardcoding.</p>

<p>The full details are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">here</a>, but to be honest I don&#8217;t fully understand it as writen.  What I understand of it is from trial and error.</p>

<p>This entry is an attempt to codify that understanding and apply it using the ruby language.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>The inputs to the policy are:</p>

<ol>
<li>User or Actor</li>
<li>Action being performed</li>
<li>Resource being acted on</li>
</ol>


<pre>
    +-------------------------------------------------------+
    | +-------+                                +----------+ |
    | |       |            +------+            |          | |
    | |  User |+---------->|Action|+---------->| Resource | |
    | |       |            +------+            |          | |
    | +-------+                                +----------+ |
    +-------------------------------------------------------+
                               +
                               |
                               v
                            +------+
                            |Policy|
                            +------+
                               +
                               |
                               v
                          +---------+
                          |Yes or No|
                          +---------+
</pre>


<h2>Policy</h2>

<p>The policy is where the business logic goes.  It can be as simple as a set of Ruby classes that simply return values, or it can be as complicated as ActiveDirectory.</p>

<p>The players are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Role - collection of permissions bound to a user</li>
<li>Permission - an answer which is limited to a resource and action</li>
</ol>


<p>Here is the basic flow of a permission:</p>

<pre>
    +------+            +------+             +------------+
    | User |+---------->| Role |+----------->| Permission |
    +------+            +------+             |------------|
              Has many            Has many   | Resource   |
                                             | Action     |
                                             | Allowed?   |
                                             +------------+
</pre>


<p>A user can have 1 or more roles.  Each role can have 1 or more permissions.  Each permission associates an action on a resource with an answer.  Either the user is explicitly allowed or explicitly not allowed to access the Resource.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> I have purposely kept the data model simple.  In more complicated setups there can be several levels of permissions, permissions can have filters, and/or permissions can be directly bound to a user (instead of being bound to a role).  These complications are often introduced to deal with edge cases which are outside the scope of this article.</p>

<h3>Policy logic sample code</h3>

<p>Once the actors are known the logic is easy.  Simply filter in only the permission on a user for the resource and action in question then &#8220;and&#8221; all permissions together.</p>

<h2>Working prototype</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://jkamenik.github.com/assets/Technical%20Debt%20Calculator.pdf">working prototype</a> is a clickable PDF.  You will need Adobe Acrobat Reader or a Mac computer.  From there just download the PDF and play with it.</p>

<p>I used concepts that I gained from working with <a href="http://keynotopia.com/">Keynotopia</a>.  Keynotopdia is an awesome library, which you should own, but at a minimum you should check out their tutorials <a href="">here</a>.</p>

<p>I did not use any assets from their library because their License doesn&#8217;t allow me to share the Keynote files if I do.  However, I wanted to allow people to download my base library and hopefully help me improve my design.  The Keynote file can be found <a href="http://jkamenik.github.com/assets/Technical%20Debt%20Calculator.key">here</a>.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think, in the comments below.  In a later post I will talk about my findings.</p>

Every morning when I am about to start work I open Spotlight (<code>cmd + space</code> for me) and type &#8220;startwork&#8221;.  The first app that shows up is my Automator workflow for opening all the programs that I need to work.</p>

<p>Here is my Automator workflow:</p>

<p><img src="http://jkamenik.github.com/images/start-work.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The apple script (The first action)</h2>

<p>This is a template apple script that just launches all my applications.</p>

<ol>
<li>Adium - An OS X chat client that can almost all IM protocols.</li>
<li>Waterfall Campfire - My company&#8217;s campfire chatroom isolated inside a Fluid app.</li>
<li>iTerm - My terminal of choice.</li>
<li>Tower - My git client of choice.</li>
<li>RubyMine - My IDE of choice.</li>
</ol>


<p><em>Note: I use &#8220;activate&#8221; with iTerm, because &#8220;launch&#8221; throws an error</em></p>

<h3>Assigning apps to desktops</h3>

<p>Automator cannot do this for you (at least not yet).  But I am very particular about where and how I like my windows setup.  Luckily the Mac remembers the last window settings on exit, so moving things around, resizing windows, and quitting does the trick.  However, it does <strong>not</strong> remember which screen an app is on.</p>

<p>To assign an app to open on a specific screen follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the app</li>
<li>Move the app to the screen you want (using mission control)</li>
<li>Switch to that screen</li>
<li>In the dock

<ol>
<li>Right click the application icon</li>
<li>Click Options -> Assign To -> This desktop</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p><em>Note: this only effects where the app opens, you can move windows to other screens anytime you want</em></p>

<h2>Opening URLs (Last 3 actions)</h2>

<p>The last three actions are the easiest way I can find to open multiple URLs in the same browser at once.  The automator task uses the system&#8217;s default browser which for me is Chrome.</p>

<p><em>Note: the URLs are opened in a semi-random order.  I don&#8217;t know how to fix that.</em></p>

<p>I like to open URLs as close to where I actually do my work as possible.  The trick is hacking the URLs.  These are the URLs that I use most.  Other URLs come and go - like right now where I open github.</p>

<ol>
<li>Pivotal Tracker - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/<code>project id</code>

<ol>
<li>I tend to work on a single project for long periods of time so I just open that project every time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Google Mail - https://mail.google.com/mail/u/<code>multi-login index</code>

<ol>
<li>The <code>/u/...</code> tells google to open a different logged in account.  I <em>always</em> log into my personal gmail account first (index 0) and my work account second.  So <code>/u/1</code> is my work email.</li>
<li>If you add <code>/u/...</code> but aren&#8217;t logged into google multiple times it will ask you to login again.  This can be jarring if you are not expecting it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Basecamp - https://basecamp.com/<code>account-id</code></li>
</ol>

    <link href="http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2013/09/01/technical-debt-calculator/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-01T20:40:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2013/09/01/technical-debt-calculator</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All projects have some amount of Technical Debt.  And for projects I manage I am tired of keeping that knowledge in my brain.  My idea, and an example of UI mocking, is to create a technical debt calculator which can store the choices made on a project and map how those choice interfere with other choices.</p>

<p>The term Technical Debt refers to &#8220;any work that needs to be performed before a particular job can be complete.&#8221;  That is true, but I don&#8217;t like the wording.  Instead I am going to define it as &#8220;any choice that makes future progress more difficult or impossible&#8221;.</p>

<p>A project is defined by the choices.  Good or bad, every choice adds debt that must be juggled.  In fact, when a person is &#8220;in the know&#8221; that is referring to the fact that they know most-if-not-all the technical debt of a given project.  I find those people to be useful as a well of knowledge, but not as forward thinkers.</p>

<p>There is something about keeping all the Technical Debt knowledge that makes you adverse to change.  It isn&#8217;t technical debt that kills projects per se it is the keepers of technical debt that resist change that do.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My drive for this project is to not become a keeper-of-technical-debt on any project, and to communicate the debt clearly.  Often times when a project starts the time from talk to fully formed featured is hours or days.  1 - 3 years in and the same amount of effort is 1 to 2 days.  And on large projects that have taken several direct changes the time can be 1 to 2 weeks.  The only change being the number of previous choices.</p>

<h2>The good choices</h2>

<p>My calculator is meant only to track the bad choices or old choices.  There are some &#8220;good&#8221; choices that will slow forward progress, but ultimately prevent larger issues.  Here is a short list of something that will add time to the project but should NOT be considered technical debt:</p>

<ol>
<li>TDD/BDD</li>
<li>Agile methods</li>
<li>Using existing frameworks</li>
<li>QA</li>
<li>Code reviews</li>
<li>Local builds</li>
<li>Continuous integration</li>
<li>Saying &#8220;no&#8221;</li>
<li>Having confidence and a direction</li>
</ol>


<h2>Existing State</h2>

<p>I spend a little bit of time with pen and paper taking notes and drawling prototypes.  In the future I will expand on these ideas, but for how here they are in their raw form.</p>

    <updated>2013-08-29T08:47:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2013/08/29/using-keynote-for-mockups</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of UI mockup software out there.  I am sure they are good, but chances are that you already have exactly what you need.  I used to ominigraffle, which was fine.  And I know people that use Visio.  And there are a ton of UI Mocking software out there that costs a ton.</p>

<p>However, I have found presentation software (specifically Keynote) already has all the features you need for a good UI mockup.</p>

<p>Features of Keynote:</p>

<ol>
<li>Almost everyone knows how to create a presentation</li>
<li>$20 on the app store (that is not a sales price)</li>
<li>Presentation ready</li>
<li>Master slides, which allows

<ol>
<li>Crafting static backgrounds</li>
<li>Text placeholders</li>
<li>Custom guidelines</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Hidden slides

<ol>
<li>Allows for templating common items, but not showing them in the presentation</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Clickable elements

<ol>
<li>Allows simulating of a working UI.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<!-- more -->


<p>Here is my step by step for creating UI mockups.</p>

<h2>1. Use pen and paper</h2>

<p>Paper and Pen are the fastest way to get your ideas out of your head.  The other good thing about pen and paper is that you are not nessissarly constrained by UI medaphores built into a computer.  If you are trying to think of a better way to do something using a computer that is subtly forcing your into common UI patterns then that is the direction you will head.  You will not end up with anything better then before and you will likely have wasted a lot of time doing it.</p>

<p>Paper is supposed to be fast, not perfect.  So only use standard printer paper and a black pen.  Nothing more.</p>

<h3>1.1 Paper layout</h3>

<p>Fold the paper like <a href="http://jkamenik.github.com/images/paper_in_8s.jpg">this</a>.</p>

<p>This gives you 16 slides to play with (8 on each side).  Also, it roughly simulates landscape and portrait layout of a screen.  I recommend sacrificing one slide with a orientation arrow (point to the top of the sheet) and short title.  Definitely not a requirement, but it helps when you come back to these slides after a week.</p>

<h3>1.2. The shotgun</h3>

<p>Take part of the UI metaphor and shotgun different ideas on all 16 slides (15 if you want to keep a title).  Spend no more then 10minutes on it, or about 35s / slide.  All you are trying to do is come up with ideas on what might work.</p>

<p>After that spend some time on each slide deciding what does and does not work.  Cross out the complete failures.  Circle things you like.</p>

<p>Repeat this as much as you need to.</p>

<h3>1.3 Story-board</h3>

<p>If you are creating a multipart UI then take everything that worked and story-board out the progression.  Use only the elements that worked.  You might find that when story-boarded things, that you thought would work, don&#8217;t work.  There is not harm shotgunning some new ideas.</p>

<p>Each state of the UI is a single slide.  For example, if I am looking to demo a warning message when a user checks a checkbox then I would draw one frame with the button unchecked and no warning, and another with the button checked and a warning.  You can fill in the rest of the slides with other states or you can leave them blank.</p>

<h3>1.4 The reveal</h3>

<p>Don&#8217;t give a formal presentation.  Just show your slides and explain what you are trying to do.  Ideas will fly, so take notes.</p>

<p>One of two things will happen during the reveal: 1) the ideas are fine, but need a little work.  Or 2) everything about the idea is wrong.  If there are only minor tweaks then I recommend <strong>not</strong> redoing anything paper and instead moving on to more formal design.</p>

<p>If everything is wrong then stop now.  No harm, no foul.  You either didn&#8217;t have enough to go on, or your ideas weren&#8217;t clean.  Either way you only spent 10 to 20 minutes on something that was likely to fail anyway.  It probably best if the project is scrapped or rethought.</p>

<h3>How do I share paper with remote workers?</h3>

<p>Good question!  That is why white paper without lines, and a blank pen are so important.</p>

<p>You share the document by scanning it with a scanner (if you work in an office) or you take a picture of it with your smart phone!</p>

<h2>2. Setup a master document</h2>

<p>Keynote isn&#8217;t really meant for everyone to edit at the same time.  But you can create a master document which you share with the team so that everyone is on the same page.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start by creating a new document with the &#8220;White&#8221;.</li>
<li>Open the &#8220;Master Slides&#8221; menu: View -> Show Master Slides</li>
<li>Delete all the master slides except &#8220;Title &amp; subtitle&#8221; and &#8220;Blank&#8221;</li>
<li>Fill out the title slide</li>
</ol>


<h2>3. Template common elements</h2>

<p>At this point you should have a rough set of slides or a story-board and the basic master document.  You may have 10s or 100s of slides that need to be converted to digital, but before any of that create common UI elements.</p>

<p><a href="http://keynotopia.com/">http://keynotopia.com/</a> and things like it can be purchased to augment your UI collection.  Copy over or create the UI elements that are present in your story board.</p>

<p>Once you have a good set of common UI elements in one or two slides mark them skipped slide: Slide -> Skip slide.  This will let you later copy and paste elements but skip the slide during presentations.</p>

<h2>4. Create common backgrounds (using master slides)</h2>

<p>Just like creating common UI element, creating master slides lets you quickly throw together backgrounds.  More importantly editing the master slides causes every slide to update.</p>

<p>A master slide is just like a normal slide except that it can be used as the base for other sides.  For that reason anything that you put in a master side is not editable in a normal slide.  The exception is text which can be marked as a placeholder and changed in the slide.</p>

<p>I recommend building master slides in the following manner.</p>

<h3>4.1 Background object</h3>

<p>As a standard slide you can put any objects including shapes, and text.  The rule of thumb is to start with a recognizable background.  For websites that means creating something that looks like a web browser.  For a iPhone app create the outline of an iPhone.  For a computer program create common window.</p>

<p>Since these objects aren&#8217;t editable in slides you may find that you create quite a few master slides with different aspects of the project.  That is a good thing.  You master slides will ballon as your design balloons, which is another form of feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You may also want to create a slide that simulates scrolling to the middle or bottom of the page.  Just add a right scroll bar to the right at different positions: top, middle, bottom.</p>

<h3>4.2 Guides</h3>

<p>Once you have the master slide objects in place you will notice that the center of the usable area will not be centered the center of the slide.  This makes it difficult to position things on slides in a consistent way.  To make it easy again add guides.</p>

<p>Show the rulers: View -> Show Rulers.  Then grabbing the top ruler and dragging down will add a horizontal guide.  Grabbing the left ruler and dragging right will add a vertical guide.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> I add guides on the edges (like the sides of the iPhone screen).  Then I add guides in the middle.  Sometimes I will also add guides at the golden mean, or thirds, but never both at the same time.</p>

<h3>4.3 Placeholders</h3>

<p>Any text box can be a placeholder which means that the text can be modified on the slide.  When doing a website I make the browser title and URL bar a placeholder.</p>

<p>To create a placeholder first add a &#8220;Text box&#8221;, place it where you want, and give it a good default value.  With the item selected open the <strong>Inspector</strong> and go to the <em>Master Slide</em> tab.  Check &#8220;Define as Text Placeholder&#8221; and give it a unique name.</p>

<p>A slide can modify a placeholder in any way it needs to.  This includes changing size, position, or even deleting the item entirely.  But it is a really good way to add quickly configurable defaults.</p>

<h2>5. Create UI (using slides)</h2>

<p>With the master slides and templates in place it is a simple matter to create slides.  A slide should contain no more then would fit on a single screen; remember presentation slides don&#8217;t scroll.  If you need a multipage slide split it over 2 or 3 slides.</p>

<p>Do not try to make the screen interactive.  That is not the purpose of a presentation.  Stick with duplicating the paper slides.</p>

<h2>6. Create interaction (using clickable items)</h2>

<p>You could stop at step 5 and give a pretty great presentation, but sometimes you really want to take things over the top.  Keynote allows you to make objects hyperlinks, which can link to another slide, a webpage, or another presentation.</p>

<p>In the design view there is a visual clue that the item is clickable, but not during the presentation.  And since hyperlinks can jump forward or backwards in the presentation this feature can get you into a lot of trouble.  It is very important that the entire presentation be closed to finished before adding hyperlinks.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To help you stay out of trouble, duplicate a slide and only change one item.  Then link from the first slide to the second in a way that makes sense, and be sure to link from the second back to the first.  Resist the urge to have the second slide link anywhere but to the first slide.</p>

<h2>7. Don&#8217;t Add details</h2>

<p>You can spend hours adding details which will either need to be completely removed and redone or will be ignored.  The goal is to provide enough fidelity to be useful but not enough detail to reach the &#8220;uncanny valley&#8221; of sorts.  If the fidelity of the design is too high then people start picking apart the details, and stop thinking about the presentation.</p>

<h3>Uncanny Valley</h3>

<p>This is a term borrowed from the field of human aesthetics that states &#8220;[it] is the region of negative emotional response towards robots that seem &#8216;almost human&#8217;&#8221;.  See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">wikipedia article</a> for details.</p>

<p>The issue doesn&#8217;t stop with humans judging humans, it takes place anytime a human judges something that seems familiar.  Especially computer programs.  Basically, as we add detail there is a point right before &#8220;perfect&#8221; which is so bad that it is worse then if stopped at the hand drawings.</p>

<ol>
<li>Nothing -> neutral</li>
<li>Drawings -> good</li>
<li>Keynote -> better</li>
<li>Keynote with details -> <strong>HORRIBLE!!!!</strong></li>
<li>Actual implementation -> best</li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So part of my job has been to give screencasts of some of the projects I have been working on.  Having a Mac I can use iMovie to pretty much do everything, but I struggled with the structure and timing of the screencasts.</p>

<p>The issue was that I know pretty much everything about the feature I implemented, so I would just go at it.  I would often get confused, start over, or go off on a tangent.  By the end everything took longer then it should, and wasn&#8217;t as good as it should have been.  Over all very frustrating.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why I didn&#8217;t think about this sooner and why this isn&#8217;t the first thing people tell when you start doing screencasts, but start with a screenplay.  The movie industry has decades of experience and they start each movie with a pitch and a screenplay.</p>

<p>Think of a screenplay like a wireframe for your video.  Everything about them is about making things simple to understand.  Below is a simplified version of <a href="http://2012.scriptfrenzy.org/howtoformatascreenplay">the screenplay format</a> applied specifically to screencasts.</p>

    <link href="http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2013/07/24/foundation/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-24T20:34:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2013/07/24/foundation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> is a UI library which aims to simplify design by starting with a responsive library.  It is very similar to Twitter Bootstrap, but since it uses SCSS it should fit better within Rails.</p>

<p>The demo for what I have done is <a href="http://jkamenik.github.io/waterfall-foundation">here</a></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It would be accurate to say that I have a little crush on this framework.  In my day to day I have to deal with Drupal Designers.  They are not bad people to be sure, and the designs they come up with are great.  But there is no structure to what they provide.  They are painting using waterfall colors on a still pond.  The stuff they come up with is amazing, but if you do anything but look at it all is lost.</p>

<p>Foundation is an apt name because it offer an underlying structure to design.  It has opinions, but as a Rails guy I am used to that.  More importantly the opinions are those of designers, but with a structure that resonates with developers.  So not being a designer I can still develop a decent UI.</p>

<h2>The downside</h2>

<p>First the downside, it doesn&#8217;t support IE lower then 8 and only partially supports IE8.  That isn&#8217;t a huge issue for me, but it does make it difficult to use commercially.  Other then that I don&#8217;t see any issues.</p>

<h2>The grid</h2>

<p>Foundation uses a 12 column grid system to control the layout of elements.  12 is great measure because it divides by 2, 3, 4, and 6.  It also supports the nesting of grid rows within columns.</p>

<h3>Large / Medium / Small</h3>

<p>When defining columns you can give it a span by adding the column count like &#8220;large-9&#8221;.  Just so long as counts add to 12 everything works.  But what is awesome is that each column can be different based on screen size.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;small-6 medium-7 large-9&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This causes the div to be 6 columns when the screen is small, 7 for medium screens, and 9 for large screens.</p>

<h3>Push / Pull</h3>

<p>Add &#8220;push-X&#8221; cause a column to pad left by the number of columns.  &#8220;small-9 push-3&#8221; means the column is 9 wide and moved over by 3 columns, basically making it the last column even if in the html it is first.</p>

<p>&#8220;pull-X&#8221; does the opposite and moves a column to the right.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;small-9 push-3&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Last on screen, first in HTML.<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;small-3 pull-9&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>First on screen, last in HTML.<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Show / Hide</h3>

<p>Adding &#8220;show-for-X&#8221; will cause the div to be hidden unless the screen is the correct size.  There is a &#8220;hide-for-X&#8221; as well.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;show-for-small&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Shown only if small<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Semantic HTML</h2>

<p>Foundation uses semantic HTML in order achieve a responsive design.  And hence why IE7 and below are not supported and IE8 is only partially supported.  But semantic HTML plays very well with the mobile web and makes the HTML easier to code and maintain.</p>

<h2>The Widgets</h2>

<p>Along with the opinions come standardized UI widgets.  It isn&#8217;t on the same level as a GUI toolkit like ExtJS, but all the basic HTML behaviors are there plus a lot of other nice items.</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>A &#8220;nav&#8221; element acts as a standard menu with dropdowns on a desktop.  In a mobile browser it becomes a set of clickable links that sweep left.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h3>Panels / Flash</h3>

<p>These can be used to display a &#8220;block&#8221; of text.  They have some standard highlights like &#8220;alert&#8221; which makes them good for flash messages.</p>

<h3>Joyride</h3>

<p>A joyride lets you highlight elements on the page with some descriptive text.  It is as simple creating a unordered list with the class &#8220;joyride-list&#8221;.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to add a Table Of Contents (TOC) to some of my longer blog entries.  Here is how I did it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Full credit it due to a google search which turned up this <a href="https://github.com/bmc/brizzled/blob/master/source/_posts/2012-02-04-generating-a-table-of-contents-in-octopress.markdown">https://github.com/bmc/brizzled/blob/master/source/_posts/2012-02-04-generating-a-table-of-contents-in-octopress.markdown</a>.</p>

<p>I followed it to get an idea of what I wanted, but diverged a lot.  What I wanted was:</p>

<ol>
<li>The TOC to be driven by a <code>toc: true</code> in the YML front matter of any page</li>
<li>The TOC to be the first item in the sidebar.</li>
<li>The TOC to contain only the h2 tags and below (Ignoring the H1 page title)</li>
</ol>


<h2>1. Add JS TOC code</h2>

<p>Download the <a href="http://fuelyourcoding.com/scripts/toc/">jQuery TOC plugin</a> and move the js file into javascripts directory.</p>

<p>Add the following code to the head.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>_includes/custom/head.html</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.1.min.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;/javascripts/jquery.tableofcontents.min.js&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;/javascripts/generate-toc.js&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This downloads jQuery from a CDN, loads the TOC plugin and will eventually load our driver code.</p>

<h2>2. Write the driver and trigger code</h2>

<p>Create the driver code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>javascripts/generate-toc.js</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Adjust the footer to trigger the TOC is needed:</p>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>page</code> variable is the YML front mater hash so we can check for <code>toc</code> to ensure the trigger code is only included on pages that want a TOC.</p>

<h2>3. Adjust the generators</h2>

<p><code>rake new_post</code> and <code>rake new_page</code> generate a stub page with some YML head matter so it make sense for me to adjust the generators to include <code>toc</code>.</p>

<p>Just add something like this to the <code>Rakefile</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My last blog entry was when my son was born.  A perfect reason for a blog entry, but I had fully intended to keep blogging and just didn&#8217;t find the time.  Turns out the issue isn&#8217;t really that I don&#8217;t have the time, but that I don&#8217;t have the time write the really involved articles.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There is nothing wrong with a fully detailed article, when the time permits.  However, I have a great many partially started articles that still need hours of research and development to finish.  My previous process something like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find a concept</li>
<li>Initial research</li>
<li>Outline</li>
<li>Code spike / actual developement</li>
<li>Refactoring</li>
<li>Final code (something to be reasonably proud of)</li>
<li>Start the blog</li>
<li>More research</li>
<li>Final blog</li>
<li>Proof read - Send to editor</li>
<li>Publish blog</li>
</ol>


<p>Clearly, way to involved to involved to do every week with the time I do have.  The new goal is eposodic entries that may not be fully formed, but would eventually lead to a fully formed article.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Comcast 30 day challenge fails, except in challenging my nerves!</p>

<p>I feel angry and scammed, but instead of ranting I am just going to give the timeline with some commentaries.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Everything below is factually accurate, but for libel reasons I will be leaving out the name of persons involved, as well as specific locations.  The place where initial contact was made will be known as &#8220;the mall&#8221;, the sales agent as &#8220;A&#8221;, the installation tech as &#8220;the tech&#8221;, Comcast support will be known as &#8220;S1&#8221; and &#8220;S2&#8221;, and the equipment recovery support will be known as &#8220;R1&#8221; and &#8220;R2&#8221;.</p>

<p><code>My commentary will have this format.</code></p>

<h3>Final Outcome</h3>

<p>Lets start with the final outcome, which was effectively a 3 hour no-op.  There is a lot of anger because we feel duped, but no money changed hands, and I was able to reset my previous service provider without incident.  There is loss of recorded programs on the DVR, but that is the only loss I have suffered.</p>

<p>I suffered 2 days (of the free 30) with the wrong services and a constant set of &#8220;we can&#8217;t help you.  Talk to some one else&#8221; answers.  During that time the internet (though not the correct server) had several outages.</p>

<h3>Timeline</h3>

<h4>November - June - Worry sets in</h4>

<p>Worrying about money and the cost all subscription services.  Verizon isn&#8217;t horrible at $116 / month for very stable internet and some HD channels, but other then mortgage and utilities it our single greatest monthly expense.  We don&#8217;t have movie channels because we have both NetFlix and Amazon Prime.</p>

<p>I am out of contract with Verizon so my cost could jump at any time, but at least I am not locked into a 2 year contract.  Doing online research has not yielded any options that are better.</p>

<h4>Early June - Small changes</h4>

<p>Cancel NetFlix since we barely watch it and have amazon which offers streaming video as well.</p>

<h4>June 5th, 2013 - Sign up</h4>

<p>Wednesday was a rough day and we decided to go to the mall to eat dinner.  After dinner we walked the mall and ended up in a Big Box store.  We were looking at the $199 Chromebook when <strong>A</strong> approached us.</p>

<p><code>Yes we are a emotional eaters.</code></p>

<p><strong>A</strong> was quite nice and we have been looking for a cheaper service anyway.  He tells us about the &#8220;$400 per year challenge&#8221; where comcast can save you over $400 a year with the same or better service.  After discussing what we have, he tells us about the package he has for $72 / month for 1 year.  The package is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Digital Preferred Plus TV</li>
<li>50mb / s Internet</li>
<li>HBO, Showtime and Max</li>
</ul>


<p><code>Sounds too good to be true.  We are sceptical.</code></p>

<p><strong>A</strong> then says that we don&#8217;t have to pay for anything now and we get to try it for 30 days for free.  We sign up for installation Tuesday afternoon.  He takes the form and returns with the brochure which he writes on.</p>

<p><code>What the hell.  If it works, great.  If not it isn't going to cost us anything.</code></p>

<p>On the drive home we get a text from <strong>A</strong> asking when we wanted the installation.</p>

<p><code>Now I am on guard.  This seems like all the old problems I have had with Comcast.  Memories of bad service, and bad support come flooding back.</code></p>

<h4>June 10th, 2013 - Red flags</h4>

<p>We get a welcome package from Comcast and it has nothing in it that remotely looks like what we were told about.  The advertised packages were triple play and much more then we are willing to pay.</p>

<p><code>Red flag 1.</code></p>

<p>Later that night I get my confirmation call.  The call says that the install will &#8220;arrive between 8am and 10am&#8221;.</p>

<p><code>Red flag 2.</code></p>

<h4>June 11th, 2013 - The install</h4>

<p><code>I work from home.  So I am always there during the day.  I rearrange things so that I won't need the internet.</code></p>

<p>Around 8:30am the tech arrives.  He walks around the yard examining things then comes to the door.  He asks if I have ever had Comcast.  &#8220;Not at this address&#8221;.  He tells me that there is no line to the house so he going to have to check some things.  He comes back a few minutes later and says that the only option is to run a cable over the driveway, and across the yard and later they will run an underground line.  I have to sign a waiver because it is a tripping hazard.</p>

<p><code>I figured he was going to try to take the cable directly through a wall like happened at another house.  So I am happy to sign the waiver.</code></p>

<p><code>Remember that they schedule an appointment to bury the line.  It comes up later.</code></p>

<p>Tech runs the outside line and connects it to the line that already goes into the house.  Then comes in saying &#8220;I have a DVR, digital receiver, and cable modem where do you want them&#8221;.  I say &#8220;The DVR in the living room, the modem in the laundry room.&#8221;  He asks &#8220;where is the other TV?&#8221;</p>

<p><code>Red flag 3.  I anly have 1 TV, and **A** knew that.</code></p>

<p>Tech says &#8220;You should call your sales guy.  Service order says I have to install 2 TVs.&#8221;  <strong>A</strong> warned me to txt him before calling in case he was with a client.  So that is that what I do.  Meanwhile the tech installs the cable box, which has to update.  Then he goes about installing the modem.</p>

<p><code>Awesome, soon I get my internet back.  I have been working without it, using my phone for email and other things that require me to be connected.  Soon I will be able to push what I have done to github.</code></p>

<p>Tech installs the cable modem and needs a computer to activate it.  He uses a spare machine I have.  It installs a bunch of packages like always, which I can&#8217;t risk infecting my work computer.</p>

<p><code>I hate that Comcast has this as a requirement, but at least I have a work around.  Verizon had a similar policy, but I was in the middle of moving and didn't have a computer so their tech used a verizon laptop to complete the installation.  No such luck with Comcast so it was a good thing I had a spare laptop.</code></p>

<p>Immediately after configuring internet I check my work machine.  It is able to connect, but can&#8217;t get online.  After 5 min of debugging it suddenly works.</p>

<p><code>Checking the modem logs the next day I found that the DHCP server kept crashing, which explains why machine was on Wifi but couldn't talk to anything.</code></p>

<p>Checking speedtest.net I find that I am only getting 20mb /s down.  I tell the tech it should be 50mb.  He says &#8220;you need to call your sales guy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then heads back to check the cable box.  Asks &#8220;what service do you have&#8221;?  &#8220;Digital Perferred Plus&#8221;.  His response &#8220;Oh well that&#8217;s not what is enabled on this box.  You should call your sales man and get this correct.  There is nothing I can do.  I could call support but they might not be able to help, but it would cost you.&#8221;</p>

<p><code>Wait what!?!  Support at comcast costs money now, and they can't help you with problems?</code></p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t gotten a response back from <strong>A</strong> so I give him an actual call.  The phone goes to voice mail and the voice says &#8220;the user has not setup their voicemail, goodbye&#8221;.</p>

<p><code>Red flag 4.  Holy hell!  A salesman that can't be reach and Comcast unable to help.  F'</code></p>

<p>About 10 minutes later I get a call back and explain the situation.  The tech is doing cleanup so he is still here.  <strong>A</strong> tells me to have him take back the spare tuner and he will correct service tomorrow.</p>

<p><code>Not what I want to hear, but at least things will be corrected soon.</code></p>

<h4>June 12th, 2013 - The fail</h4>

<p><strong>7:30ish</strong> - I start work and try speedtest.net again.  Still 20mb.  <strong>A</strong> must not be at work yet.</p>

<p><strong>10:50ish</strong> - The internet goes out for about 10 minutes.  Great.  <strong>A</strong> corrected my account.  <code>or so I thought</code></p>

<p><strong>11am</strong> - Internet comes back so I check speedtest.net.  Still 20mb.  <code>WTF?!? Less then one day in and I am already have network outages?</code></p>

<p><strong>11:03am</strong> - I txt <strong>A</strong> &#8220;Any word on getting my package corrected?&#8221;.  I then go about figuring out why the Internet went out.  From the modem logs it appears the DHCP (needed for computer to talk to the internet) crashed.  The time wasn&#8217;t exactly right, but modem timestamp might not be accurate so that is my best guess.</p>

<p><strong>4:10pm</strong> - I txt <strong>A</strong> &#8220;4pm and still word nor is the service working correctly&#8221;.  Then realize my mistaken and txt &#8220;Still no word*&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>6:50pm</strong> - I call Comcast back on a number they called me from after the appointment.  Turns out that is just the survey line and they can&#8217;t transfer me.  They give me an alternate number, but that is the best they can do.</p>

<p><strong>6:52pm</strong> - I Comcast at the number provided.  A few menus later and a short wait I am talking to retainment agent <strong>S1</strong> about canceling service.  I explain the situation and she wants to see if she can correct my service before canceling.  I am on hold for about 10minutes when she comes back to tell me that I have to talk to my sales person.</p>

<p><code>Now I am thinking that I need to talk to the sales person to cancel.  Crap!</code></p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get ahold of him.  Just cancel the service.&#8221;  <strong>S1</strong> says &#8220;sorry for all the problem we can certainly cancel your account.  Since you are in the 30day window there will be no charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>A short wait later <strong>S1</strong> says &#8220;You service is now canceled.  Do you have any questions at this time?&#8221;  &#8220;Are you going to send me a box so that I can return the equipment.&#8221;  She says &#8220;No, but I can redirect you to a recovery agent.&#8221;</p>

<p><code>Crap.  I have been on the phone for more then an hour and now I have to talk to someone else.</code></p>

<p>Another short wait and now I am talking to <strong>R1</strong>.  For verification reasons I have tell her all my account details.  Then she says &#8220;I am sorry, but we cannot collect your equipment Comcast has you down for a service call in 2 weeks so until that is finished there is nothing I can do&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; I say.  &#8220;I literally just got done canceling and was redirected here.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>R1</strong> says &#8220;I am sorry sir, but we are not Comcast.  We are a 3rd party.  You need to call Comcast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine, please transfer me back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry sir I cannot do that.  You have to call them back yourself.&#8221;  So I hung up.</p>

<p><code>Now I question if Comcast is a company or a loose collection of people whose job it is to bounce you around like ping pong balls.  Have I even been talking to Comcast?</code></p>

<p><strong>7:15pm</strong> - I call Comcast back, wait again, and go through the same verification as before.  Now I am with <strong>S2</strong> who just like <strong>S1</strong> attempts correct my service and will not help until she does.  I give her all the details.  She says &#8220;Sir that is not a package that we offer.  What I can do is waive the DVR for a year and give you HBO and your cost is only $89.99 / month&#8221;.</p>

<p><code>Oh hell no.  I was sold $72 all in, no contract, including 3 movie channels.  Now I am being switched to a waived DRV (read contract required) and less for more?</code></p>

<p>I say &#8220;No that is worse then I was sold.  But I already canceled the service and at recovery they told me they could collect because I had an outstanding appointment.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>S2</strong> says &#8220;Let me check&#8230;  I see they have an appointment in 2 weeks to bury a line, but&#8221;  I cut her off &#8220;but since I canceled there isn&#8217;t a need to bury a line.  Can you please cancel that appointment so I can have my equipment collected?&#8221;</p>

<p><code>I shouldn't have cut her off, but it has been almost 2 hours of being bounced around and no one can help me completely and accurately.  I need to start being clear and not giving openings because I still have to make dinner.</code></p>

<p><strong>S2</strong> says &#8220;Ok sir.  We can cancel that appointment.  If that is all I can transfer you back to recovery.  Have a nice day.&#8221;</p>

<p>A short wait, and re-verification of my account later I am talking to <strong>R2</strong>.  She ask when I would like someone to pickup the stuff.  So I schedule it and hang up.</p>

<p><strong>7:30pm</strong> - I disconnect the Comcast line to the house and reconnect the Verizon line.  I then pull out all the Comcast parts and replace them with my Verizon equipment.  I leave the Comcast DVR because we taped a several things yesterday that we want to watch and collections isn&#8217;t for several days.</p>

<p><code>When we tried the DVR later it was bricked by corporate.  Nothing worked.  So those shows are lost to us now.  Thank god for online streaming.</code></p>

<p><strong>7:42pm</strong> - I text <strong>A</strong> &#8220;No worries.  Several calls to support later.  Comcast is canceled&#8221;.  I then start writing this blog.</p>

<h2>Our Experience</h2>

<p><strong>12:30am</strong> Melanie starts labor, but can&#8217;t wake me up.  It didn&#8217;t even dawn on me that it could have been actual labor.  In my defense I am a heavy sleeper so it was difficult to get me up.</p>

<p><strong>2am</strong> Melanie was able to get me fully awake.  I was still unsure what was happening, so I wanted to time the contractions.  Having gone to the labor class I knew that we needed to time contractions: 511, 5 minutes apart, for a 1 minute duration, for 1 hour.  I also knew that false labor, which can sometimes be very painful, proceeds real labor but up to several weeks.</p>

<p><strong>2:20am</strong> We are DONE timing contractions!  Or rather my continuing health demands we stop timing contractions.  The contractions have Mel on the floor with back labor, and she is going to kill me.  Under explicit instructions, tears, and anger I call the on-call Doctor on Mel&#8217;s behalf.</p>

<p><strong>2:40am</strong> We are at the Hospital and Mel is headed to Triage.  I get to wait in the labor waiting room until they have checked her and decide to admit her.</p>

<p><strong>3:00am</strong> We are in the labor rooms.  Very nice and roomy and private to each labor.  Big enough for a couch (where I was sleeping) several chairs, the labor bed, the baby examination table/heater, sink, bathroom, and medical supply room.  Right now it is a waiting game of doctor checks.</p>

<p><strong>5am</strong> Mel gets the epidural.  It is a sterile procedure so I had to wait in the waiting area again.  It takes just under an hour and 2 attempts to get the epidural in correctly.</p>

<p><strong>6am</strong> We start posting updates to friends and family.  We figured it was nicer to wait until at least a standard start of the day and not send the invites at 3am when we were actually admitted.  Mel&#8217;s pain is much less, but so is the strength of the her contractions.  Now her progression has to be monitored more closely, and pitocin administered if needed.</p>

<p><strong>7:30am</strong> Mel has progressed to 7-8cm so we tell her parents to head down.</p>

<p><strong>8am</strong> Mel&#8217;s water is broken by the doctor, but she is still progressing.  No need for pitocin, yet.</p>

<p><strong>9am</strong> Mel&#8217;s parents are here.  And she is progression nicely to 9cm.</p>

<p><strong>10am</strong> Francis is still at 0 station.  He has engaged, but is not progressing.  We are on a watch because the contractions are not constant.</p>

<p><strong>10:30am</strong> Francis heart rate dropped below safe rate and immediately above safe range.  The external monitors are removed and internal monitors added in hopes that the blips were Mel&#8217;s movements and not the actual measurements of the baby.</p>

<p><strong>11am</strong> The new monitors are MUCH more painful, since the vagina is not numbed by the epidural, but she endures.  Also, the progression has stopped, and Francis continues to have heart flutters.  And Mel&#8217;s own blood pressure is setting off alarms right and left.  We are given the option to start pitocin, wait things out, or as the doctor recommends start talking about a C-Section.</p>

<p><strong>11:15am</strong> We had already decided that if something like this happened we were OK with the C-Section.  Mel is terrified of surgery, since she has never had surgery.  Her mother, having had 2 C-Sections, gives her the low down on what it is like.  That, knowing I will be there, knowing they will block her pain, and knowing she will be awake is enough for us to move forward.</p>

<p><strong>11:45am</strong> All the extra sensors are removed, she is in the OR, and I am sitting in the recovery room waiting to be called in.</p>

<p><strong>12pm</strong> In the OR with Mel, Doctor has made the first cut.</p>

<p><strong>12:48pm</strong> Francis is pulled out and immediately begins crying.  Normally this is great but in our case there is meconium in the amniotic fluid, so we don&#8217;t want him to aspirate it.  So the peditritians take him immediately to the examanation table.  All is fine now, but we have to watch him carefully over the next few days.  It is possible for him to develop a lung infection.</p>

<p><strong>+3 days</strong> We are heading home, Francis is fine.</p>

<h2>What we have learned</h2>

<ul>
<li>Opinions due little but sully the otherwise very special moment</li>
<li>Nothing goes as planned</li>
<li>Babies have an inverted sleep schedule</li>
<li>Breastfeeding is f&#8217;n hard!</li>
<li>Breasts are purely functional</li>
<li>Nipple confusion is a much smaller concern then it seems</li>
<li>The &#8220;connection&#8221; is not instantainious for all women</li>
<li>&#8220;Baby amnesia&#8221; comes along slowly</li>
<li>You never have enough diapers</li>
</ul>


<h3>Opinions</h3>

<p>Facts are great, and even talking about experiences are nice.  But spouting opinions sucks, and we have been inundated.  Here are just a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Circumcision is mutilation and has a good change so killing your boy:</em> <strong>false</strong>.  Very little of this is factually actuate, but it is spouted with such fervor as to be unquestionable.  If you want your boy circumcised then do, if you don&#8217;t that is fine to.  Make the choice and ignore all detractors.</li>
<li><em>Breastfeeding is </em>always<em> better then formula:</em> <strong>false</strong>.  There are benefits and drawbacks for both breastfeeding and formula.  We choose breastfeeding, but think nothing less of women that choose formula.  You have to pick what is right for you.</li>
<li><em>Never use a pacifier/bottle when breastfeeding:</em> <strong>false</strong>.  We have tried a bottle, and continue to use a pacifier and have no problem with nipple confusion.  Do what is right for your baby, your life, and you; the rest will take care of itself.</li>
<li><em>Epidural are selfish, bad, you will have problems:</em> <strong>false</strong>.  Just not true.  Mel wanted a natural birth, but when the pain of back labor was too much the epidural was needed.</li>
<li><em>Labor is a beautiful things:</em> semi-<strong>false</strong>.  I can see why it is though of as beautiful, and at the highest level it is.  But in the details of the pain, strain, lack of sleep, frustration, fear, and expectation it is more real then beautiful.  The rememberance of Labor will be beautiful - I am sure - but right now things are real.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Nothing goes as planned</h3>

<p>During our planning class the nurse suggested that we &#8220;let the baby drive&#8221;.  Basically do not create a written list, because you will stress over details before labor and when things do not go as planned it will add fuel to the baby blues after labor.</p>

<p>In our case we had a general plan and almost nothing worked out as we wanted.  In the end we had a healthy baby boy and the plan of not planning worked out pretty well.</p>

<h3>Babies sleep during the day</h3>

<p>There are many guesses as to why this is, but basically once born they sleep all day and are awake at night.  Francis was born in the middle of the day, and was nearly impossible to wake up for the first 24 hours.  His bladder and bowels worked fine, so the doctors were not concerned.  In fact, almost a week later and it is still almost impossible to wake Francis after a good feeding during the day, and impossible to get him to sleep after a good feeding during the night.</p>

<p>Right now the only things we can do is keep playing with him during the day (to the point of annoyance), and ignore him at night.  By &#8220;ignore&#8221; all I mean is we can&#8217;t make eye contact, talk to him, pet him, or talk to him (yes I said it twice).  We still pat him to burp him, shush, and bounce him to aid in sleeping, but nothing else.  Easier said then done, but we persist.</p>

<h3>Breastfeeding is hard</h3>

<p>One of the major opinions that is implicitly or explicitly stated is that every baby MUST be breastfed.  And as a women it should be the most natural thing in the world.  Guess what?  It&#8217;s not.</p>

<p>Babies do not know how to breastfeed, and more importantly they do not want to breastfeed.  They spend 9 months being given food with no work, but now they have to work for food.  And they have to work hard!</p>

<p>Worst still a women&#8217;s breast must change to make breastfeeding possible.  So even if the want is there it is very frustrating for many days/weeks.  And sometimes it will never be possible.  In our case we have to use a Nipple Shield to start the feedings because the nipples are flat and Francis doesn&#8217;t know to start sucking.</p>

<h3>Breasts are purely functional</h3>

<p>When we were in the hospital there were no less then 20 people help Mel and I breastfeed Francis, and there was nothing weird about it.  We both thought of it only in terms of what gets Francis food.</p>

<p>Even now we don&#8217;t bother drawing the curtains when breastfeeding.  There just isn&#8217;t anything weird about having a breast hanging out in prep for breastfeeding, nor is there anything sexual about it.  They have a single purpose, which is as a food supply.</p>

<p>It is the equivalent of getting aroused by a hamburger; just not something that happens (normally).</p>

<h3>Nipple confusion</h3>

<p>I guess we made the mistake of telling the doctors that we planned on breastfeeding.  The reason that I said &#8220;mistake&#8221; is because &#8220;nipple confusion&#8221; is such a pervasive argument that they removed all formula, bottles, and pacifiers that are normally provided after labor.</p>

<p>In fact, on one night it took us and several nurses over 6 hours to get just 1/2 oz of colostrum into Francis.  And during all that time breastfeeding was the only option.  It was horrible.</p>

<p>The lactation consultant seeing the medical necessity did eventually give us a breast pump, and pacifier, but no bottle.  We had to use a syringe to provide colostrum through a tube next to a finger that simulated a nipple.</p>

<p>It took a several complete feeding failures, and finally giving Francis to the nurses so we could sleep, to just get him some formula.  In fact, we weren&#8217;t allow to feed him the formula, only the nurses could and only because they could not get him satisfied otherwise.</p>

<p>It has been almost a month, we use pacifies, use bottles, and the breast and we can safely say that he has no nipple confusion.  Perhaps it is something that affects only some babies, or it is something that really hasn&#8217;t been studies and is just take as fact.</p>

<h3>The &#8220;Connection&#8221;</h3>

<p>This seems to me like the female equivalent of &#8220;comparing sizes&#8221;.  When asked women almost universally say &#8220;it was instantaneous&#8221;, or something similar.  And I am sure 3 to 6 years after labor when first asked it seems instantaneous, but it is not for some women.</p>

<p>The &#8220;connection&#8221; is real, but it takes many days, even a week or more before it really kicks in.  And assuming that <strong>all</strong> women have an instantaneous connection really just adds fuel to the baby blues.</p>

<h3>&#8220;Baby Amnesia&#8221;</h3>

<p>It has been about a month and the baby amnesia is just now starting to kicked in.  It is definiately not as originally discribed: a clam that washes over you.  It is not instantaneous.</p>

<p>Basically what happens (at least for us) is you start forgetting the details, pain, and difficulty.  And you also start to realize exactly how much you can actually deal with.  And Francis is quite, content, and smiles and you realize how awesome it is.</p>

<h3>Diapers</h3>

<p>An infant eats every 2 hours to 3 hours during the day, and 2 to 5 hours during the night.  And they pee and poop between feedings.  You would think that 12 diapers / day is about average, but it isn&#8217;t.  As adults we have learned to urinate and defecate during the same bathroom trip.  the same is not of babies.  For them they will urinate and defecate as two separate acts, and to prevent diaper rash you have to change them between each act.  That doesn&#8217;t even account for the partial pee/poop, in which they start pee or poop as soon as you take the diaper off.  And in a lot of cases they will pee or poop as soon as you get the diaper back on; and in some cases do it 3 or 4 times in a single changing.</p>

<p>24 to 30 diapers / day is closer to accurate.</p>

<h2>Why leave the comment below?</h2>

<p>So a number of people have asked me why I left the comment below.  It is rude, and it is hurtful to have someone try to sully the birth of my child with &#8220;yet more opinions&#8221;.</p>

<p>In fact, this type of comment is EXACTLY what I was talking about in the &#8220;What we have learned&#8221; section.  Just for fun I have turned my post and her comment into a conversation.  Hopefully it shows how ridiculous the comment is, and why I think it is important to leave up.</p>

<p><em>me:</em> Opinions suck! They lead to a lot of mis-information.</p>

<p><em>jane:</em> No <strong>your</strong> opinions suck.  Mine opinions are actually FACT!</p>

<p><em>me:</em> Turns out that Epidurals are sometimes necessary for hard deliveries.</p>

<p><em>jane:</em> No, they <strong>are</strong> selfish!  With my first child I had a beautiful natural birth.  With the second I <strong>had</strong> to have a epidural and there were nothing but problems.  As you can see clearly, it was the epidurals fault.  But I am not downing epidurals.</p>

<p><em>me:</em> Breastfeeding is hard.  Frankie wants to do it, but has such a bad overbite that he can&#8217;t lock.  We have had repeated visits from the Lactation consultant and every nurse on the floor has tried to help us, but still nothing.  He is loosing weight and all we want is to get something in him.  Everyone tells us that nipple confusion can happen, but for christ sake lets get at least a little food into Frankie.</p>

<p><em>jane:</em> Babies want to breastfeed, and I also had some trouble.  I had to things like pull out my nipple before each feeding.  Clearly you guys are lazy and stupid!  You need to try harder.  Also, your are wrong nipple confusion <strong>CAN</strong> happen!</p>

<p><em>me:</em> I didn&#8217;t say nipple confusion doesn&#8217;t happen.  What I was saying was that we were told that nipple confusion was instantaneous.  Put your baby on the bottle once and that is all-she-wrote.  That is not the case with Frankie, but never mind you aren&#8217;t listening anyway.</p>

<p><em>jane:</em> Also, circumcised boys <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> breastfeed so you are double stupid!</p>

<p><em>me:</em> Wait, what?  I never said one or the other that I circumcised Frankie.</p>

<p><em>jane:</em> Well it doesn&#8217;t matter.  From the way you talk it is clear that you did.  I read part of your above story, judged your entire life, and walked through all the bad choices you made (entirely within my mind).  I started writing this comment to educate you, so that your child won&#8217;t be a serial killer.  Because &#8220;scientific evidence&#8221; shows that <strong>ALL</strong> serial killers were bottle fed!</p>

<p><em>me:</em> (eyes glazed over)</p>

    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2012/11/22/bunco-phase-1-dot-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is just a slight addendum to the <a href="http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2012/11/21/bunco-phase-1/">Bunco Phase 1</a> Post.  After having used the score card in several games there are a few issues that arise with the existing layout.</p>

<ol>
<li>Input is cumbersome</li>
<li>The interface is SLOW!</li>
<li>Cannot correct screw ups</li>
</ol>

<h2>Cumbersome input</h2>

<p>It is hard to tell how well a design is going to work without actually using it.  When we actually started to use it we noticed that it was too difficult to keep track of whose turn it was and it really slowed down the game.  This is exactly the opposite of what using the phone as a scorecard should be.</p>

<p>The major reason for the slow down is that we maintain the player turn state in the app.  More specifically I <em>force</em> the management of whose turn it is.  I had done this as a way of saving space, but when implemented it sucked.</p>

<p>I redesigned things a bit to include score buttons for each player.  But in order to fix the buttons I had to lose the header and refresh button.</p>

<p><img src="http://jkamenik.github.com/images/bunco/ScoreBoard_2.png"></p>

<h2>Slow!</h2>

<p>Between clicking a score button and seeing the score applied and being able to click the button again was at least 1 second.  Not huge if you only need to enter a small number of inputs.  But a long game can take up to 246 inputs ((21 + 20)*6).  So in just the inputs it takes more then 4 minutes!  The problem is that rolling the dice is very quick with a long game being less then 2 minutes.</p>

<p>I used the Safari profiler and it was very clear that 99% of the total time was in repainting the view.  I use Backbone to get the events and a simple MVC, and as such you would expect it to refresh the view using the new data.  Specifically <em>all</em> the time was taken after triggering the &#8220;create&#8221; event.</p>

<p>The template that repeats for each round is:</p>

<h3>Find and replace, instead of rerender</h3>

<p>Rerendering shouldn&#8217;t really be an issue, but it turns out that jQuery Mobile does a huge amount of DOM pollution, which is hugely expensive.  It would be much faster if we could just find and replace single items and regenerating the entire page.</p>

<p>I changed the template to include more IDs to making finding items faster and easier:</p>

<h2>Screw ups</h2>

<p>Adding points to the wrong user happens, and for the time being I still don&#8217;t have a good answer.  But then again there are a lot of design changes to be tested before we try to tackle this.  It is hard to tell if this will even be an issue now.</p>

    <updated>2012-11-21T08:21:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2012/11/21/bunco-phase-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Phase 1 is always a learning experience.  Often very little work is done, but a lot of research is done.  I generally do not like that approach.  Instead I like to start out simple and let that guide me.  And it has guided me to a initial working version at <a href="http://jkamenik.github.com/Bunco">http://jkamenik.github.com/Bunco</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The Target</h2>

<p>Before any design could start I first had to decide what language, what library, what device, and how it will be accessed.</p>

<h3>Device</h3>

<p>I have my phone with me everywhere I go.  So it is a clear choice as the scorecard and input device.  The only question then becomes: do I host it from the web, or create a native app?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know native iPhone, but I know that PhoneGap can be used to generate a native app from a hosted one.  So I can still go native if I want, but I don&#8217;t have to start with an all or nothing approach.</p>

<h3>Hosting</h3>

<p>Now that I have decided on using the phone and hosting I have to figure out where to host and let that inform what else is available to me.</p>

<p>I could use a standard LAMP install on a hosting provider, but those can get expensive.</p>

<p>I could use a home server with DDNS to reverse port through my firewall, but I don&#8217;t like maintaining my own infrastructure.</p>

<p>I could use a Micro Amazon EC2 instance (free for the first year), but again I have to do a lot of setup.</p>

<p>I could use Heroku and either spin-up a simple Node.js or Ruby on Rails app.  Actually I started doing this, but then decided that in this stage with the need to message between phones it was overkill to even setup a server.</p>

<p>That is where Github Pages comes in.  I already use them to serve my blog, and a few other things.  And I am pretty much serving a static site.  All I have to do is work out of a git branch called gh_pages and everything will just work.</p>

<h3>Lanuage and Libraries</h3>

<p>Knowing that I am serving a static site from GitHub I open to using the web, but limited into things that are pre-compiled and static.  And since it going to be for the iPhone jQuery Mobile is a natural fit because it just uses HTML5&#8217;s Semantic markup features.</p>

<p>I could use CoffeeScript - in fact if it gets any bigger I will - which compile to Javascript, but has a lot of niceties I am used to when working on Rails.  But since this isn&#8217;t a full blown Rails 3.2 app - with the full asset pipeline and compiling, minifying, and cache busting that goes along with it - the boon of CoffeeScript is slightly diminished.  Also, since I am starting with a library I haven&#8217;t used before it might be more complicated debugging a CoffeeScript bug vs a jQuery Mobile bug.  I will leave CoffeeScript on the back burner for now.</p>

<h4>Aside (Backbone.js)</h4>

<p>As an aside, when I started I was writing raw JS hashes, but was having trouble keeping things sorted.  I remember my days of using ExtJS, which is great for managing complex GUIs, but very large.  Then I remembered Backbone.js which is what I use now.  Much smaller, and less cumbersome.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>Once all the limitation are know (or at least most of them) everything starts with a design.  And I am not graphic designer, so I usually just go at the problem using rails.  Not really an option here.</p>

<p>But since I plan on using jQuery Mobile, right on their website they have a embedded designer.  The output is HTML5 markup with the &#8220;data&#8221; flash that jQuery Mobile uses.  Here is my initial design:</p>

<!-- image here -->


<ol>
<li>Header - Refresh button and title</li>
<li>Footer - Scoring buttons: 0, 1, 5, 21</li>
<li>Body - The score board.  Players across, Rounds down.</li>
</ol>


<h3>The score board</h3>

<p>Very quickly I figured out that I really didn&#8217;t have the room for the scoreboard.  Not without shrinking the size of the text to unreadable levels.  So I had to switch to another style.</p>

<p>Enter the accordion.  Instead of a grid where I see all scores I use an accordion showing the round number of the scores for both players.  Sure only really get to the see the score of current round, but I can just add the winner of the round to the visible title and that solves the problem.  Plus it takes up less room total, which is a win.</p>

    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2012/11/10/bunco</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The rules of Bunco are very easy, but you really do need to have 12 players or so.  Mel and I were able to modify the rules to work better for just two players, but it is very annoying to have to have record score with such a fast paced game.  I would like to eventually allow Mel and I to play the game over the internet like <em>Words with Friends</em>.</p>

<p>See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunco">Bunco</a></p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>Like I siad the rule are very easy, but they can and do change based on the group you are with.  The official Bunco site has the rules for a full group of 12 people.  And they only deal with multiples of 4.  We are 2 people so we are going to modify the rules a bit.  They are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are 6 rounds (each corresponding to a number on the die)</li>
<li>Each player roles 3 dice</li>
<li>1 point is gained for each die matching the round number</li>
<li>5 points are gained if all dice match (but don&#8217;t match the round number, i.e. 5,5,5 in round 1)</li>
<li>21 points are gained if all dice match the round number</li>
<li>The player keeps rolling until no points are gained in a role</li>
<li>The first player to 21 points wins the round</li>
<li>The player that wins the most round (4 of 6) wins</li>
</ol>


<h2>Aproach</h2>

<p>I find that if I approach a project from Ivory tower then it ends up being to big and I will not start anything.  I find that if you split things up into distinct steps it is easy to get started.  Also, between each step you can evaluate the success over the previous step, expand or contract the next step, or change directions entirely.</p>

<h3>Phase 1 - Infrastructure / Design / Score Card</h3>

<p>This phase is probably too big, but the end goal is to have a clean but simple score board.  It has to work, but it has to work well and be better then a pen and paper.  Also, part of the design we have to choose the infrastructure including: the online hosting provider, the language, the libraries, and the client.</p>

<h3>Phase 2 - Add Dice</h3>

<p>Once we have a simple score board going it shouldn&#8217;t be too much work to add rolling of the dice to the game.  This step is kept purposely small because there are likely a lot of things learned in the previous section and will bleed into this phase.</p>

<h3>Phase 3 - Multiplayer</h3>

<p>The end goal is to be able to have two players to play over the internet.  So we have to think about things like maintaining sessions, user signups, tracking stats, keeping users in sync, and realtime signaling.</p>

<p>This section is way to big, but it is too early to go into too much detail.  It is going to be interesting to see how
close I get to my ultimate goal, and how long it takes to get there.</p>

    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2012/11/02/the-long-away</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The Reason</h2>

<p>First, let me apologize to my 3 readers that I have been away for so long.  There are a lot of reasons why I have been gone, but mainly it boils down to how much I hate the blogger interface for dealing with code.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Sure, blogger is a simple platform and does exactly what it says.  Sure, it integrates with google plus, twitter, etc&#8230;  Sure, it was easy to configure, setup and deploy.  Sure, it has a lot of features.</p>

<p>But, it sucks for code!  And I mean Sucks!  For code there are a few very specific hot button items that are must haves:</p>

<ol>
<li>Monospaced font and significant whitespace (&lt;pre> in HTML)</li>
<li>Line numbers</li>
<li>Syntax highlighting</li>
</ol>


<p>Not that much to ask, but those features are ONLY ever going to be needed by a programmer.  So I can see why they don&#8217;t get that much attention.</p>

<p>Both the old and the new blogger interface have a way of dealing with this, but it is time consuming and annoying:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use gist.github.com as a dumping place for all your code samples

<ol>
<li>Create a separate file in the gist for each sample (makes it easier later)</li>
<li>Make sure the file name has the right extension so that syntax highlighting happens</li>
<li>Copy the embed codes for each gist</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>When editing the blog only use HTML mode!

<ol>
<li>The gist code is a javascript so it will only render in preview</li>
<li>Switching between HMTL and compose sometimes rearranges non-visible items, which means when your page renders your code could be anywhere</li>
<li>If I am going to write raw HTML I might as well use Markdown, which sucks less and converts to HTML</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Hope that nobody views your blog with JS disabled!</li>
</ol>


<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>After playing with many blogging solution and giving up on Wordpress entirely (Sorry I just cannot get what I want without a LOT of php hacking), I have decided to give a Octopress a serious shot.  I use github all the time and even host a few things using github pages.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t know, Github pages can render Jekyll sites.  And Jekyll is a blog aware static site generator, which can read markdown.  And Markdown is a much more human friendly markup language then HTML, but compiles into HTML; also, Github uses it everywhere in their site (as do a lot of other places).</p>

<p>So things started to fall into place with Jekyll.  I just needed to install a syntax highlighting gem, and design the site.  In the process, I stumbled across Octopress, which is a wrapper around a Jekyll site, works with github, has syntax highlighting, provides a clean theme, and has a programmer friendly workflow.</p>

<p>So Octopress is the blog engine for me.  And it will reside at <a href="http://jkamenik.github.com">http://jkamenik.github.com</a>.  I will slowly be transferring all my entries from here, but I doubt I will retire this site entirely.</p>

    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2012/09/11/testing-rails-in-ie-though-pow</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>My Problem</h2>

<p>I can&#8217;t test in IE (but the client wants it to work in IE 7 and IE 8)</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>My Setup</h2>

<ol>
<li>A mac - because I need it to work the first time every time</li>
<li><a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rvm.io">RVM</a> - because you should be using it</li>
<li>PostgreSQL - it is better then MySQL and actually easier to setup after you do it once.</li>
<li><a href="http://pow.cx">Pow</a> - because it is small, spins up the rails server when you need it and the url looks like http://myhost.dev, not http://127.0.0.1:3000 (some browsers will attempt to look up &#8220;localhost&#8221; via google search, before asking DNS)</li>
<li>TDD

<ol>
<li><a href="http://cukes.info">Cucumber</a> - because it is easier to read integration level testing</li>
<li><a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec">Rspec</a> - because I like it (it both backs cucumber, and also us the unit testing for models and libraries)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit">Capybara-webkit</a> - so the browser is opened headless and doesn&#8217;t intrupt other work</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<h2>My Solution</h2>

<p>First do everything as normal, since you will be developing faster and only at the END worry about IE.  This is counter to a lot of thinking, but I have found that if you stick to good TDD and are testing using an actual opened browser then the only issue you will end up with are CSS related issues.</p>

<h3>Before you start</h3>

<p>Since it is likely that you will only have CSS issues it is a requirement that you make the main CSS work on HTML5 compliant browsers.  And add exceptions for the others.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;![endif]--&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Use a Windows VM</h3>

<p>Go to https://github.com/xdissent/ievms and install the various IE VMs.  I have not had luck with IE6 and IE7, but IE8 works fine.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | <span class="nv">IEVMS_VERSIONS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;8&quot;</span> bash
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If it fails, just keep rerunning it, or try a different version</p>

<h4>Boot and wait for driver detection</h4>

<p>On first boot I usually go in as Admin and let windows detect everything and install all the needed components.  This isn&#8217;t a genuine version of windows so after 30 days you will be locked out, at which point you just need to revert to the &#8220;clean&#8221; snapshot.</p>

<h4>Install the OS extensions</h4>

<p>For some reason the CD doesn&#8217;t autoplay for me.  Just enter &#8220;d:&#8221; in the Start Menu -> Search and then select the installer.</p>

<h4>Add Fake DNS</h4>

<p>Pow munges DNS on the Mac so that you don&#8217;t have to use &#8220;localhost&#8221;.  I actually really like this about Pow and so will remain using it.  The only thing that you need to do is edit the windows Hosts file and add the Fake DNS there as well.</p>

<ol>
<li>Login as the IEUser</li>
<li>Start -> Search -> &#8220;Notepad&#8221;</li>
<li>Right click and select &#8220;Open as administrator&#8221;</li>
<li>File -> Open</li>
<li>Change URL to &#8220;C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts&#8221;</li>
<li>Add the following (change the host names as you need)

<ol>
<li>&#8220;10.0.2.2       myhost.dev&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;10.0.2.2       myhost1.dev&#8221;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Now open http://myhost.dev in IE and it will work</li>
</ol>

    <updated>2012-05-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jkamenik.github.com/blog/2012/05/20/the-problem-with-best-practices</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I hate the term &#8220;Best Practices&#8221; for two important reasons.  First, in an attempt to be concise the eliminate the most import information: the reasoning.  They are often just the call-to-action statement. and they are often passed down as policy.  Some best practices are good practices (for example pre-flight checklist) when applied to the correct situation.  But without the reasoning statement, it is hard to tell if the practice can be applied to other situations.  If I had to apply a pre-flight checklist before starting to code then I would waste a huge amount of time.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Second, best practices eliminate critical thinking.  With a misnomer like &#8220;Best Practices&#8221; it is not surprising that they are not questions.  And in most situation questioning a &#8220;Best Practice&#8221; is taken as an affront to the person/department that introduced the Best Practice.  I am not sure why this is, because very rarely is a Best Practice the best practice for every situation.  But since they defy questioning once instituted they become technical dept when they outlive their usefulness.</p>

<p>Instead of &#8220;Best Practices&#8221; I prefer &#8220;Pro Tips.&#8221;  But the name itself is not as important as to how it is presented.  In order for me to consider a &#8220;Pro Tip&#8221; it must have three parts: a list of benefits, a list of drawbacks, and description of behavior.</p>

<h2>A best practice: Always backup your work using git</h2>

<p>I do not think that any software engineer is going to argue that backing up work is a good thing.  But by phasing it this way the problem because that &#8220;git&#8221; becomes an afterthought and therefore an annoyance.</p>

<h2>A Pro Tip: Use git as a journal</h2>

<p>Using git as a backup mechanism is a good thing.  But it is better to use git to journal what you are doing.  So instead of work for an entire day, committing everything at a single time, and then pushing everything at once you should do a single complete thing, and commit that.  Usually commits happend every 5 to 10 minutes, but they are generally self contained.</p>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your work is backed up</li>
<li>You and others can see your train of thought</li>
<li>You can return of any point and attempt other options</li>
<li>You eliminate the fear of trying new things</li>
<li>Focused work</li>
</ol>


<p>Drawbacks:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have to know git to make the most of it</li>
<li>You have to take the time to make smaller commits</li>
<li>You have to push more often</li>
<li>You might have to start branching in order to keep organized</li>
<li>Difficult for messy thinkers (tinkerers)</li>
</ol>


<p>See: a pro tip is a bit longer, and more detailed, but at the same time it is more convincing.  The reader can then choose when and how to try the tip, and also is free to adapt the tip to their given situation.  For example: a developer is going to use git differently then a designer; but git could be useful for both.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The &#8220;Everyone else&#8217;s job is easy&#8221; is a easy trap to fall into and an almost impossible trap to get out of.  My point is best illustrated using the stereotypical Employee/IT relationship.</p>

<p>The stereotype from the Employee&#8217;s perspective is this &#8220;I hate dealing with IT.  They are a bunch of asses, and never do things right, and my computer is alway worse after they leave then it was with the problem that I called them for.  What is their problem?  It is their f&#8217;n job to keep these computers working so that I can do my job.  I have no interest in working this weekend because IT was not able to get my computer fixed in a reasonable amount of time.  When ever I walk by their desk they are always goofing off, if they only did their job I could do mine, how hard could it be.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stereotype from the IT&#8217;s perspective is this &#8220;I have to fix everyone&#8217;s stupid computer.  If only they would read that Wiki article I emailed about the proper way to do this thing then I wouldn&#8217;t have to keep fixing things.  I tried to prevent these kind of issues by not giving admin rights to users, but they always need to install some piece of crap software, and they won&#8217;t take the time to learn to take responsibility.  After all with great power comes great responsibility, and I see none of it.  In addition to keeping everyone&#8217;s computer working all the damn time I also have to keep all the internal and external services running.  Besides most of the time these people are on the phone chit-chatting, or standing around the water cooler; clearly their job easy enough for a monkey, so why should I rush.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>It was a pretty extreme example, but I bet that everyone has acted this way to another individual at least one.  How could you not, after all when tentions are high and emotions are frayed devaluation of other is a natural defense.  And though it is a natural defense it is certainly not an acceptable one.</p>

<p>I am certainly no Psychologist, but here are some ways I have found to prevent the escalation.</p>

<h2>1. Understand how hard everyone&#8217;s job actually is</h2>

<p>I term if difficultly, both mentally and physically here are the jobs in order from most difficult to least.</p>

<ol>
<li>Bering Straight Fishermen</li>
<li>Any other Fishermen</li>
<li>Logger</li>
<li>Political leader/Dictator</li>
<li>Fugitive</li>
<li>Mangers (above you in the company)</li>
<li>Everyone else&#8217;s Job</li>
<li>Your job</li>
</ol>


<p>Yep, once you understand that more then likely the person that you are dealing with has a more difficult job then you do then it is easier to compromise.</p>

<h2>2. Humanize</h2>

<p>This is hands down the hardest thing to do when nerves are frayed, but remember the other person in the argument is also a human.</p>

<h2>3. Eliminate Cognitive load</h2>

<p>Cognitive load is simply an amount of mental work that must be processed before learning can be accomplished.  For example, it is not uncommon for requests between departments to have to be done in a formal way, like though a task tracking system.  This is completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>If communication between departments has to be done in a formal way then it department HAS to consider every other depart as a customer.  Would you as a customer of Comcast think that it is acceptable to have to login into a Comcast support portal in order to request them to fix your TV?  No, you would call them, or email them, or do something else that is convient to you, and your would let Comcast deal with formalizing the request in a way useful to them.</p>

<p>The same has to be true between departments.  If you are in IT and you have to formally use Autotask, or Zendesk, or anything else then YOU MUST also find a way to get the requests into that system.  Other departments have to be able to call, email, or walk over to YOU and make requests.</p>

<p>But at the same time, other departments are as busy as you, so you have to remember that once asked turnaround can take a while.</p>

<h2>4. Detail the difficulty</h2>

<p>If the other person doesn&#8217;t know a lot about all your responsibilities then they are more likely to thing of things as easy.  And most of the time everything that is being asked of you is easy, because it is your job and you are good at your job; right?</p>

<p>The problem is usually more likely the amount of stuff you have to do before you can do this one other &#8220;easy&#8221; thing.  At one company I worked for we liked to call these type of situation marketing fire drills.  Marketing would have a client that promised to buy 200 hundred widgets every year if only the widget has some feature.  But we have 20 other features that have to be implemented before we can start on the new feature is started.</p>

<p>So in this case the difficulty is prioritizing all the &#8220;easy&#8221; features.  Especially since each market person was responsible for their own projects and did not have a company wide view of things.</p>

<h2>5. Be concise, but be human</h2>

<p>Often times people see conciseness as talking about work and nothing else.  But in my experience more time is wasted talking about work topics then for any other reason.  I don&#8217;t mean that work topics are a waste of time, but how many time have there been several hours of talk when 15 minutes of actual investigation would have eliminated the need for talk.</p>

<p>What I mean about being concise is only add information if it is relevant.  &#8220;Because it is always done this way&#8221; is not relevant, no matter what you might think.  So unless you have specific experience keep it to yourself.  Also, raise any relevant questions, and take any relevant advice.</p>

<p>By eliminating the work conversation waste you can and should spend time talking about personal things.  I have always been a huge fan of eating lunch away from the office with co-workers.  It is the best to respect people and be respected.  And by humanizing, barriers can be eliminated.</p>
