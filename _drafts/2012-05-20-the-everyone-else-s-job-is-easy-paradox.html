The "Everyone else's job is easy" is a easy trap to fall into and an almost impossible trap to get out of. &nbsp;My point is best&nbsp;illustrated&nbsp;using the&nbsp;stereotypical&nbsp;Employee/IT relationship.<br /><br />The stereotype from the Employee's perspective is this "I hate dealing with IT. &nbsp;They are a bunch of asses, and never do things right, and my computer is alway worse after they leave then it was with the problem that I called them for. &nbsp;What is their problem? &nbsp;It is their f'n job to keep these computers working so that I can do my job. &nbsp;I have no interest in working this weekend because IT was not able to get my computer fixed in a reasonable amount of time. &nbsp;When ever I walk by their desk they are always goofing off, if they only did their job I could do mine, how hard could it be."<br /><br />The stereotype from the IT's perspective is this "I have to fix everyone's stupid computer. &nbsp;If only they would read that Wiki article I emailed about the proper way to do this thing then I wouldn't have to keep fixing things. &nbsp;I tried to prevent these kind of issues by not giving admin rights to users, but they always need to install some&nbsp;piece&nbsp;of crap software, and they won't take the time to learn to take responsibility. &nbsp;After all with great power comes great responsibility, and I see none of it. &nbsp;In addition to keeping everyone's computer working all the damn time I also have to keep all the internal and external services running. &nbsp;Besides most of the time these&nbsp;people&nbsp;are on the phone chit-chatting, or standing around the water cooler; clearly their job easy enough for a monkey, so why should I rush."<br /><br /><h2>The problem</h2>It was a pretty extreme example, but I bet that everyone has acted this way to another&nbsp;individual&nbsp;at least one. &nbsp;How could you not, after all when tentions are high and emotions are frayed&nbsp;devaluation&nbsp;of other is a natural defense. &nbsp;And though it is a natural defense it is certainly not an acceptable one.<br /><br />I am certainly no&nbsp;Psychologist, but here are some ways I have found to prevent the&nbsp;escalation.<br /><br /><h3>1. Understand how hard everyone's job actually is</h3>I term if difficultly, both mentally and physically here are the jobs in order from most difficult to least.<br /><br /><ol><li>Bering Straight Fishermen</li><li>Any other Fishermen</li><li>Logger</li><li>Political leader/Dictator</li><li>Fugitive</li><li>Mangers (above you in the company)</li><li>Everyone else's Job</li><li>Your job</li></ol><div>Yep, once you understand that more then likely the person that you are dealing with has a more difficult job then you do then it is easier to&nbsp;compromise.</div><div><br /></div><h3>2. Humanize</h3><div>This is hands down the hardest thing to do when nerves are frayed, but remember the other person in the argument is also a human.</div><br /><br /><h3>3. Eliminate Cognitive load</h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load">Cognitive&nbsp;load</a> is simply an amount of mental work that must be processed before learning can be accomplished. &nbsp;For example, it is not uncommon for&nbsp;requests&nbsp;between departments to have to be done in a formal way, like though a task tracking system. &nbsp;This is completely unacceptable.<br /><br />If communication between departments has to be done in a formal way then it department HAS to consider every other depart as a customer. &nbsp;Would you as a customer of Comcast think that it is acceptable to have to login into a&nbsp;Comcast&nbsp;support portal in order to request them to fix your TV? &nbsp;No, you would call them, or email them, or do something else that is convient to you, and your would let Comcast deal with&nbsp;formalizing&nbsp;the request in a way useful to them.<br /><br />The same has to be true between departments. &nbsp;If you are in IT and you have to formally use Autotask, or Zendesk, or anything else then YOU MUST also find a way to get the requests into that system. &nbsp;Other departments have to be able to call, email, or walk over to YOU and make requests.<br /><br />But at the same time, other departments are as busy as you, so you have to remember that once asked turnaround can take a while.<br /><br /><h3>4. Detail the difficulty</h3>If the other person&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;know a lot about all your&nbsp;responsibilities&nbsp;then they are more likely to thing of things as easy. &nbsp;And most of the time everything that is being asked of you is easy, because it is your job and you are good at your job; right?<br /><br />The problem is usually more likely the amount of stuff you have to do before you can do this one other "easy" thing. &nbsp;At one company I worked for we liked to call these type of situation marketing fire drills. &nbsp;Marketing would have a client that promised to buy 200 hundred widgets every year if only the widget has some feature. &nbsp;But we have 20 other features that have to be implemented before we can start on the new feature is started.<br /><br />So in this case the difficulty is prioritizing all the "easy" features. &nbsp;Especially since each market person was responsible for their own projects and did not have a company wide view of things.<br /><br /><h3>5. Be concise, but be human</h3>Often times people see conciseness as talking about work and nothing else. &nbsp;But in my experience more time is wasted talking about work topics then for any other reason. &nbsp;I don't mean that work topics are a waste of time, but how many time have there been several hours of talk when 15 minutes of actual investigation would have eliminated the need for talk.<br /><br />What I mean about being concise is only add information if it is&nbsp;relevant. &nbsp;"Because it is always done this way" is not relevant, no matter what you might think. &nbsp;So unless you have specific&nbsp;experience&nbsp;keep it to yourself. &nbsp;Also, raise any&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;questions, and take any&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;advice.<br /><br />By eliminating the work conversation waste you can and should spend time talking about personal things. &nbsp;I have always been a huge fan of eating lunch away from the office with co-workers. &nbsp;It is the best to respect people and be respected. &nbsp;And by humanizing, barriers can be eliminated.</div>
