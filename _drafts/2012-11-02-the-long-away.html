<h2>The Reason</h2>First, let me&nbsp;apologize&nbsp;to my 3 readers that I have been away for so long. &nbsp;There are a lot of reasons why I have been gone, but mainly it boils down to how much I hate the blogger interface for dealing with code.<br /><br />Sure, blogger is a simple platform and does exactly what it says. &nbsp;Sure, it integrates with google plus, twitter, etc... &nbsp;Sure, it was easy to configure, setup and deploy. &nbsp;Sure, it has a lot of features.<br /><br />But, it sucks for code! &nbsp;And I mean Sucks! &nbsp;For code there are a few very specific hot button items that are must haves:<br /><br /><ol><li>Monospaced font and significant whitespace (&lt;pre&gt; in HTML)</li><li>Line numbers</li><li>Syntax highlighting</li></ol><div>Not that much to ask, but those features are ONLY ever going to be needed by a programmer. &nbsp;So I can see why they don't get that much attention.</div><div><br /></div><div>Both the old and the new blogger interface have a way of dealing with this, but it is time consuming and annoying:</div><div><ol><li>Use gist.github.com as a dumping place for all your code samples</li><ol><li>Create a separate file in the gist for each sample (makes it easier later)</li><li>Make sure the file name has the right&nbsp;extension&nbsp;so that syntax highlighting happens</li><li>Copy the embed codes for each gist</li></ol><li>When editing the blog only use HTML mode!</li><ol><li>The gist code is a javascript so it will only render in preview</li><li>Switching between HMTL and compose sometimes rearranges non-visible items, which means when your page renders your code could be anywhere</li><li>If I am going to write raw HTML I might as well use Markdown, which sucks less and converts to HTML</li></ol><li>Hope that nobody views your blog with JS disabled!</li></ol><h2>The Solution&nbsp;</h2></div><div>After playing with many blogging solution and giving up on Wordpress entirely (Sorry I just cannot get what I want without a LOT of php hacking), I have decided to give a Octopress a serious shot. &nbsp;I use github all the time and even host a few things using github pages.</div><div><br /></div><div>In case you don't know, Github pages can render Jekyll sites. &nbsp;And Jekyll is a blog aware static site generator, which can read markdown. &nbsp;And Markdown is a much more human friendly markup language then HTML, but compiles into HTML; also, Github uses it everywhere in their site (as do a lot of other places).</div><div><br /></div><div>So things started to fall into place with Jekyll. &nbsp;I just needed to install a syntax highlighting gem, and design the site. &nbsp;In the process, I&nbsp;stumbled&nbsp;across Octopress, which is a wrapper around a Jekyll site, works with github, has syntax highlighting, provides a clean theme, and has a programmer friendly workflow.</div><div><br /></div><div>So Octopress is the blog engine for me. &nbsp;And it will reside at http://jkamenik.github.com. &nbsp;I will slowly be transferring all my entries from here, but I doubt I will retire this site entirely.</div></div>
