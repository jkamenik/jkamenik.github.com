<h2>Intro</h2>Cancan is my goto when I want complex permission behaviors. &nbsp;It works very nicely with Device which is my goto for Authentication. &nbsp;Below are some my tips for making things easier.<br /><br /><h3>Pro-tip: Use Roles, apply them from most restricted to least restricted, and use separate methods/modules.</h3>Permissions,&nbsp;especially&nbsp;on complex projects, can get&nbsp;ridiculously&nbsp;complex. &nbsp;This is especially true when permissions are isolated based on attribute values. &nbsp;If you have never had to deal with such complexity, you are either&nbsp;lucky&nbsp;or very near the start of the project.<br /><br />By using roles you can make things like "a salesmen can manage lead that they create, but no other leads" easy to understand and also possible.<br /><br /><br /></div>
