Every developer has their own opinions on what tools are needed. &nbsp;This is a very&nbsp;malleable&nbsp;list, in general, but in my ten years of experience I have found some key things are are needed. &nbsp;Sure, you can live without a lot of these, but they will make your life easier.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Text Editor</span><br />A text editor is where a programmer is going to spend most of their time. &nbsp;I am sure it is nice to have all the IDE features right there in the side bar or right click menu, but a lot of IDEs (Eclipse I am looking at you) add this fluff at the expense of a truly useable text editor. &nbsp;I don't need my editor to take 15minutes to open if all I am going to do is edit a single file. &nbsp;I don't need a plugin architecture if all I want to do is edit a script and run it from the editor.<br /><br />I use TextMate right now because it has all the features I require. &nbsp;If another editor comes along (one that is updated regularly) that has them then I will switch.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Gutter</span><br />It isn't enough to have a note somewhere about the current line (for example the bottom). &nbsp;I want a gutter that takes up constant room and shows the line number as well as other things like: cursor location, folding marks, breakpoint/quick jump points.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Syntax Highlighting</span><br />This is a must! &nbsp;Sorry vi. &nbsp;It is a very quick way of determining if the syntax is correct. &nbsp;It also make the code easier to read.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">White space highlighting</span><br />Very often tabs are mixed with spaces. &nbsp;This is a no no, and if you are working with me I will not accept mixed code. &nbsp;Use one or the other, not both&nbsp;interchangeably. &nbsp;And have an editor that can show you the difference. &nbsp;If it is a feature that vi has then you better be damn sure your editor has it as well.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Vertical Selection</span><br />There are times where vertical selection comes in handy. &nbsp;Basically it places the cursor as a box and anything you type is repeated once for every line. &nbsp;Great if you need to add indentation to the front of a lot of lines at once.<br /><br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Folding</span></div><br />When programers write 1400 line functions (don't scoff you know you have done it) it is nice to hide those. &nbsp;Basically any block that is not immediately useful to me is hidden.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Hotkeys (for everything!)</span><br />The Windows method of pressing alt+X, where X is the underlined letter of the menu, is not what I mean. &nbsp;Everything should have a single hotkey combination what does exactly what I want. &nbsp;For example to run the current file as a script cmd+R seems reasonable to me. &nbsp;It also has to be single press. &nbsp;Sorry Emac ctrl+x,ctrl+r just to run a file isn't going to cut it.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Mouse Support</span><br />Yep, selection especially vertical selection is just faster with a mouse.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Quick Search</span><br />cmd+f should present a search box. &nbsp;cmd+g should quick search for what was already typed in the search box. &nbsp;And the search box should be erased when opening a new file. &nbsp;shift+cmd+g should search up instead of down. &nbsp;All search should automatically wrap without asking or prompting. &nbsp;I can see from the scroll bar that a wrap happened.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Search and Replace</span><br />Search has to support regex, with matching. &nbsp;Replace needs to support matched items (usually $N where n is the paranes set). &nbsp;Replace should allow&nbsp;replacing&nbsp;in the entire file, or just in the highlighted section.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Quick Open</span><br />When opening a directory to do not all files open in the editor. &nbsp;I just want a file browser and a place where the text files will open. &nbsp;Quick open (cmd+t in TextMate) should show a dialog listing all the files that meet my typing so that I can quickly open the one I want. &nbsp;I do not want to have to type a full path, or search for the file. &nbsp;The editor should index the file names so that I can quickly open them when I want. &nbsp;Updating of the list of files also has to happen live.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Indent Correction</span><br />Contributors&nbsp;will mix tabs and spaces because they will not enable white space highlighting. &nbsp;If the code is already checked in and I have to deal with it then I am going to have my editor re-indent the way I want. &nbsp;I will commit this first then start making changes. &nbsp;What way my changes can actually be seen and are not hidden in indentation hell.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Scripting Support</span><br />Any editor that can run scripts is an IDE. &nbsp;In many case they are better because you get a great editor first, and an ability to extend it. &nbsp;Most IDE spend a lot of time outthinking you as the user. &nbsp;More&nbsp;specifically&nbsp;they spend a lot of CPU and memory on things in hopes that they might be useful to you one day. &nbsp;This is CPU and memory that could be used by your kernel to do other things that are actually useful to you.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Command line tool</span><br />I spend a lot of time at the command line. &nbsp;So I really need to be able to open a file in the current directory (or the directory itself) from there.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Control Comments</span><br />These are comments that can be placed at the top of a file to control how the editor shows the document. They are normally hidden within comment blocks so do not affect the flow of the document, but are very useful for controlling file specific changes.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Native/Quick start/Low Memory</span><br />Java apps might work on a lot of different&nbsp;architectures, but they are dog slow and memory hogs. &nbsp;The editor I use is going to be the editor I use for almost all text work. &nbsp;I might open a lot of files at once, or I might open only a single file at a time. &nbsp;It needs to be fast.<br /><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Version Control</span><br />I use git. &nbsp;You will eventually use it as well so you might as well learn it.<br /><br />Non-locking Commits<br /><br />Distributed<br /><br />Network Fast<br /><br />Personal Branches<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Merging</span><br />SVN's merging was a joke. &nbsp;It was so bad that it made you do all the work, so you basically never did it. &nbsp;I have yet to have serious problem with GIT merging and I use it daily. &nbsp;In fact I might have 2 to 3 active branches going at one time, and I will randomly merge between them. &nbsp;It just works. &nbsp;I don't know why, nor do I care. &nbsp;And when it fails, it does so clearly. &nbsp;It doesn't just puke random output at you.<br /><br />Tags<br /><br />Cloud Repository Storage<br /><br /><br />Unit testing Framework<br /><br /><br />Continuous&nbsp;integration server</div>
