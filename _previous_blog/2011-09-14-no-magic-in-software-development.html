I have been unlucky enough to have worked with several system architects that believe in "magic." &nbsp;I am not talking about the magic that you see on stages in Vega, which Penn Jillette will tell you is alway not "magic." &nbsp;What I am talking about is the thought that any single piece of software is a silver bullet that will solve all our current problems and come with none of its own.<br /><br />In one case Rails was chosen because there is a lot of buzz in the industry and we needed to create a Web based Management Interface for a product we were developing. &nbsp;Magic, right? &nbsp;No! &nbsp;Rails is great, and I now a convert. &nbsp;I love ruby as a language, and rails is an awesome framework. &nbsp;However, it couldn't deal with joints from tables in different databases. &nbsp;It had a several month learning curve (probably less if you know ruby already). &nbsp;And it was heavier then needed for a data only API driving a Javascript only UI. &nbsp;Overall it set the project back almost a year due to misplaced expectation, and everyone (including myself) that was on the rails team, fed up with undue pressure, is now working elsewhere.<br /><br />On another project, Nagios was the chosen network monitoring software. &nbsp;Several custom workers had to be developed to monitor parts of the system not automatically managed by Nagios. &nbsp;Late in the game the monitoring software was switched to Zabbix because Nagios was to hard to install. &nbsp;It was too late to pull the existing Nagios workers or develop Zabbix workers. &nbsp;Instead of investigating the installation problems and fixing them, the plan of attack was to hope Zabbix was "magic." &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;And with the switch there are bigger wholes in monitoring since we cannot reuse the code that was done for Nagios (without additional effort).<br /><br />On the same project, there was a need to process more data in parallel. &nbsp;The original design used file IO for all processing, which doesn't scale. &nbsp;So the first solution was to use Gluster, which is a network file system to keep all the nodes in sync. &nbsp;It works by copying the file (automatically) to all other nodes in the Gluster. &nbsp;After a lot of work went into implementation it was found that if you take an IO bound disk and then copy to and from the network it doesn't unbind the disk. &nbsp;Ok to be honest it wasn't found late, it was pointed out early, but since Gluster is "magic" those facts were ignored. &nbsp;On the day before the code freeze Gluster was swapped with NFS in hopes that NFS was "magic." &nbsp;However, it was too late to update anything so NFS is on but not used.<br /><br />In his book "God, No!" Penn Jillette mentions that there is no such thing as magic. &nbsp;He doesn't mean that performed magic isn't amazing. &nbsp;What he is saying is that the what we see as "magic" is an illusion created by skilled people performing at a level beyond most normal people. &nbsp;The work required to become that good is tedious, and annoying, and would bore the pants off most normal people. &nbsp;But it takes that kind of dedication to produce the correct results.<br /><br />When I say there is no "magic" in software I mean the same thing. &nbsp;When you are standing on the inside, things do not "fall into place magically." &nbsp;Things do not "come together in the end like magic." &nbsp;It takes planning and forethought. &nbsp;It takes attention to detail; tedious, annoying, attention to detail. </div>
