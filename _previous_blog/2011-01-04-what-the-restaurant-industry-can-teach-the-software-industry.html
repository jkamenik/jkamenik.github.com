I really like "Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares." Not the American version because it is mostly drama. The British version is where the substance is. The basic idea is that Gordon has 7 days to turn a failing restaurant into a successful one. Also, four to six weeks later he returns to see how many of his ideas stuck and how the business is going.<br /><br />Unviserally if the restaurant follows his advise they do well. If they fight him they fail. His tactic in every episode are almost identical and I have taken them and applied them to the software industry. Nothing new here, just interesting how good ideas transcend industries.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Know you crowd</span><br />A lot of&nbsp;restaurant&nbsp;fail because try to be what they want and not what the customers want. &nbsp;Your location dictates what types of food you can serve, and even what decorations should be used in the&nbsp;restaurant. &nbsp;The chef/owner has to bring the concept, but that concept has to fit the area.<br /><br />The same is true in software. &nbsp;Google Wave is a good example of what not to do. &nbsp;There was no real problem to solve, and there was really no audience. &nbsp;It was a novel idea, but it lacked the understanding of what it was trying to do.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Quality first</span><br />There is a minimum quality that a sit-down restaurant must meet. &nbsp;It is entirely based on user expectation of value. &nbsp;One does not go into a sit-down and expect to order off of a "dollar menu." &nbsp;And one not expect to get preprocessed, premade, microwaved, hamburger.<br /><br />What the customer never sees, that Gordon, really harps on is a clean kitchen, quality fresh ingredients.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Elegance is more important then flash</span><br />If the restaurant looks like "tijuana puked up" then there is a good bet where all the money went and it isn't the food. &nbsp;A similar thing can be said about software. &nbsp;If the UI looks like an icon library puked on it then all the money went into adding features no one uses.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Passion and Direction are key</span><br />Any kitchen that does not have a passionate kitchen staff is doomed.  The same has to be true of your software engineers. When the passion is lost then everything falls apart.<br /><br />The other important part is direction. &nbsp;Passion without direction is bull in a china shop; great energy, but likely to cause more harm then good. <br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Do not over complicate</span><br />In Gordon's words "simple is key." &nbsp;This is just part of the reason that Twitter, and FourSquare are popular given that Facebook has both of these features. &nbsp;The problem with Facebook is that tries to do everything, and&nbsp;succeeds&nbsp;at puking features all over the place. &nbsp;Using facebook as become a job in itself, and at that point</div>
