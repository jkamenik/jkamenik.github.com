I hate the term "Best Practices" for two important reasons. &nbsp;First, in an attempt to be concise the eliminate the most import&nbsp;information: the reasoning. &nbsp;They are often just the call-to-action statement. and they are often passed down as policy. &nbsp;Some best practices are good practices (for example pre-flight checklist) when applied to the correct situation. &nbsp;But without the reasoning statement, it is hard to tell if the practice can be applied to other situations. &nbsp;If I had to apply a pre-flight checklist before starting to code then I would waste a huge amount of time.<br /><br />Second, best practices&nbsp;eliminate&nbsp;critical thinking. &nbsp;With a misnomer like "Best Practices" it is not surprising that they are not questions. &nbsp;And in most&nbsp;situation&nbsp;questioning a "Best Practice" is taken as an&nbsp;affront to the person/department that introduced the Best Practice. &nbsp;I am not sure why this is, because very rarely is a Best Practice the best practice for every situation. &nbsp;But since they defy questioning once&nbsp;instituted&nbsp;they become technical dept when they outlive their usefulness.<br /><br />Instead of "Best Practices" I prefer "Pro Tips." &nbsp;But the name itself is not as important as to how it is presented. &nbsp;In order for me to consider a "Pro Tip" it must have three parts: a list of benefits, a list of drawbacks, and description of behavior.<br /><br /><h3>A best practice: Always backup your work using git</h3><div>I do not think that any software engineer is going to argue that backing up work is a good thing. &nbsp;But by phasing it this way the problem because that "git" becomes an afterthought and therefore an annoyance.</div><div><br /></div><h3>A Pro Tip: Use git as a&nbsp;journal</h3><div>Using git as a backup mechanism is a good thing. &nbsp;But it is better to use git to journal what you are doing. &nbsp;So instead of work for an entire day,&nbsp;committing&nbsp;everything at a single time, and then pushing everything at once you should do a single complete thing, and commit that. &nbsp;Usually commits happend every 5 to 10 minutes, but they are generally self contained.</div><div><br /></div><div>Benefits:</div><div><ol><li>Your work is backed up</li><li>You and others can see your train of thought</li><li>You can return of any point and attempt other options</li><li>You&nbsp;eliminate&nbsp;the fear of trying new things</li><li>Focused work</li></ol><div>Drawbacks:</div></div><div><ol><li>You have to know git to make the most of it</li><li>You have to take the time to make smaller commits</li><li>You have to push more often</li><li>You might have to start branching in order to keep organized</li><li>Difficult for messy thinkers (tinkerers)</li></ol>See: a pro tip is a bit longer, and more detailed, but at the same time it is more convincing. &nbsp;The reader can then choose when and how to try the tip, and also is free to adapt the tip to their given situation. &nbsp;For example: a developer is going to use git differently then a designer; but git could be useful for both.</div></div>
