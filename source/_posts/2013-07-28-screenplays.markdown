So part of my job has been to give screencasts of some of the projects I have been working on.  Having a Mac I can use iMovie to pretty much do everything, but I struggled with the structure and timing of the screencasts.

The issue was that I know pretty much everything about the feature I implemented, so I would just go at it.  I would often get confused, start over, or go off on a tangent.  By the end everything took longer then it should, and wasn't as good as it should have been.  Over all very frustrating.

I don't know why I didn't think about this sooner and why this isn't the first thing people tell when you start doing screencasts, but start with a screenplay.  The movie industry has decades of experience and they start each movie with a pitch and a screenplay.

Think of a screenplay like a wireframe for your video.  Everything about them is about making things simple to understand.  Below is a simplified version of [the screenplay format](http://2012.scriptfrenzy.org/howtoformatascreenplay) applied specifically to screencasts.

I have a sample Google doc file [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tstVIrAOQlfjjttxyjK_igDmrrIFf4IYuHhNJQljOQY/edit?usp=sharing).

1. All Caps
1. 4 tabs in (2")
1. For screencasts
    1. Use PRESENTER X (omit the X if only one presenter)

      (doing something)
      
    And talking
    
    
        JANE
        
    Just talking
```

### Parenthetical ###

1. Immediately after character name
1. Used to show actions performed while talking
1. 3 tabs in (1.5")
1. For screencasts
    1. Use generic terms like "highlight", and "submit form" instead of very specific "move mouse to" and "click submit button"

### Dialog ###

1. Immediately after character name or parenthetical
1. What the character says
1. No quotes
1. Present tense
1. Only explain what isn't covered by the video
    1. For example it is fine to use Jargon like "goto google" because in the video you will be opening the browser, going to the URL bar, and typing in "http://google.com".
1. 2 tabs in (1")
