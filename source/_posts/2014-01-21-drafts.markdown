Jekyll supports unpublished posts, but Octopress does not make it clear.  This is how I fixed that for my own blog.

<!-- more -->

Octopress actually does support "published: false" in the front matter.  And because it based on Jekyll it means that those posts will be available in "preview" but will be ignored when the site is generated/published.

My main care is that I know what I can do with a post in 3 to 4 months.  So I added the the published flag to the generated frontmatter of every new post.

```ruby Rakefile
# around line 93, for me
task :new_post, :title do |t, args|
  # code omitted
  open(filename, 'w') do |post|
    post.puts "---"
    post.puts "layout: post"
    post.puts "title: \"#{title.gsub(/&/,'&amp;')}\""
    post.puts "date: #{Time.now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')}"
    post.puts "comments: true"
    post.puts "toc: false"
    # add published flag to the template
    post.puts "published: false"
    post.puts "categories: "
    post.puts "  - cat1"
    post.puts "---"
    post.puts
    post.puts "Summary"
    post.puts
    post.puts "<!-- more -->"
    post.puts
    post.puts "Post text"
  end
end
```

Additionally I want to know visually when a page is a draft.  For that I add "Draft: " to the title.

```html _includes/article.html
{% raw %}
# in the <header> tag
{% if index %}
  # add {% if post.published == false %}Draft: {% endif %}
  <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="{{ root_url }}{{ post.url }}">{% if post.published == false %}Draft: {% endif %}{% if site.titlecase %}{{ post.title | titlecase }}{% else %}{{ post.title }}{% endif %}</a></h1>
{% else %}
  # add {% if page.published == false %}Draft: {% endif %}
  <h1 class="entry-title">{% if page.published == false %}Draft: {% endif %}{% if site.titlecase %}{{ page.title | titlecase }}{% else %}{{ page.title }}{% endif %}</h1>
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}
```

Now you will see "Draft: " in front of any unpublished posts.

Manual management
-----------------

A few additional things I like to do, but I haven't automated yet are:

1. Add "-draft" to the file name.
1. Change the publish date to the day I publish the article
    1. This involves changing the file name as well as the front matter
