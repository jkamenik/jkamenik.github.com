In a [previous post]({% post_url 2013-09-01-technical-debt-calculator %}) I talked about creating a Technical Debt Calculator.  And in an [even earlier]({% post_url 2012-08-14-using-keynote-for-mockups %}) post I talked about using Keynote to mockup UIs before coding.  Here I revisit the TDC with a Keynote mockup.

## Working prototype ##

The [working prototype](/assets/Technical Debt Calculator.pdf) is a clickable PDF.  You will need Adobe Acrobat Reader or a Mac computer.  From there just download the PDF and play with it.

I used concepts that I gained from working with [Keynotopia](http://keynotopia.com/).  Keynotopdia is an awesome library, which you should own, but at a minimum you should check out their tutorials [here]().  

I did not use any assets from their library because their License doesn't allow me to share the Keynote files if I do.  However, I wanted to allow people to download my base library and hopefully help me improve my design.  The Keynote file can be found [here](/assets/Technical Debt Calculator.key).

Let me know what you think, in the comments below.  In a later post I will talk about my findings.
