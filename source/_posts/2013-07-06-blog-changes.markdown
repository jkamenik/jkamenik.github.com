My last blog entry was when my son was born.  A perfect reason for a blog entry, but I had fully intended to keep blogging and just didn't find the time.  Turns out the issue isn't really that I don't have the time, but that I don't have the time write the really involved articles.

<!-- more -->

There is nothing wrong with a fully detailed article, when the time permits.  However, I have a great many partially started articles that still need hours of research and development to finish.  My previous process something like:

1. Find a concept
1. Initial research
1. Outline
1. Code spike / actual developement
1. Refactoring
1. Final code (something to be reasonably proud of)
1. Start the blog
1. More research
1. Final blog
1. Proof read - Send to editor
1. Publish blog

Clearly, way to involved to involved to do every week with the time I do have.  The new goal is eposodic entries that may not be fully formed, but would eventually lead to a fully formed article.  To that end I have codified my goals (more as a ways to keep myself inline) [here]({{root_url}}/blog-goals).

## Knowledge / Continously updated pages ##

In addition to adjusting the way I blog I am also going to move continously updated content out of blog entries and into individual pages.  The [Knowledge]({{root_url}}/knowledge) section of the blog is dedicated for these.
