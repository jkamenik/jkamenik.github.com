## Leave your ego at the door. ##

For me this is a two parter.

1. As the listener don't take what is being said personally.  The only way you can improve is to understand that you aren't as good as you think or hope you are.
1. As the speaker you have to be brave enough to be honest even if the words aren't "politically correct." It often takes more effort to walk-on-egg-shells then it improves anyone.


## Don't stand on Ceremony ##

Obviously this literally means "don't hold rigidly to protocol or formal manners".  People oft forget that "protocol" and "manners" are arbitrary, and in a lot of cases are solely used as a separation mechanism.  A "I am better then you" mechanism.  In the end the major looser is you, since you will have eliminated many people based on something arbitrary.
