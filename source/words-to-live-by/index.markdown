## Don't over complicate.  ##

Just don't.  The world is complicated enough as it is.  Same as KISS, but nicer: Keep It Simple Stupid!

## Leave your ego at the door. ##

For me this is a two parter.

1. As the listener don't take what is being said personally.  The only way you can improve is to understand that you aren't as good as you think you are.  There is some truth in even the most critical of advice, but if you take it personally you will become defensive.  You will start to pick apart the advice (often using fallacies) and finally dismiss it outright.  So not only won't you improve, but you are in a defensive posture and will be less responsive as well.
1. As the speaker you have to be brave enough to be honest even if the words aren't "politically correct." It often takes more effort to walk-on-egg-shells then it does to speak the truth.  Effort better spent making yourself, your team, your product better.


## Don't stand on Ceremony ##

Obviously this literally means "don't hold rigidly to protocol or formal manners".  People oft forget that "protocol" and "manners" are arbitrary, and in a lot of cases are solely used as a separation mechanism.  A "I am better then you" mechanism.

Some ceremony has a place.  I for instance like [Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)).  Here ceremony has a purpose.  A Scrum is 15 minutes in length regardless of team size, so to ensure everything runs smoothly ceremony must be defined.

Other types of ceremony like "Not wearing white after labor day." or being required to wear slacks and a tie to an office and worthless.
